I am working on a CAS implementation, and I want to make sure I

customizing Sakai for use with the LDAP systems which of course I had to
develop some code for.  However based on the documentation at:



http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENTR/CASifying+Sakai



Do I understand it correctly, that when setting up CAS with Apache using
a mod_cas configuration that I do NOT need to make changes or update any
existing Sakai code?  If so, how is the userid passed into Sakai?  Is
that done because of setting 'container.auth=true' in the
sakai.properties file?  As well as the changes in the login.vm?



Thanks in advance.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/5>","Yup, I think this is spot-on. Either/or, in reality, is actually neither
and both. We've had many discussions internally at SUNY about just how
loose our coupling can be. You start from either end and you work toward
the middle. But as a teaching and learning person, as a person who is
going to live in this app every day, I feel a strong sense of personal
urgency to put the issue of the long tail of learning applications as a
core design concern (which is why, by the way, that I think this
discussion belongs on the dev list and not the advocacy list). This is
not an issue of making your LMS cooler or sexier or more interesting.
It's about making it more *useful*. Regardless of whether ""LMS"" or ""VLE""
is your preferred term, there is an ""L"" in there somewhere. 

Look, I'm a teacher. I don't care whether you guys decide to use flux
capacitor or an oscillating overthruster. I just want a good environment
to teach in. And my perspective as a teacher is that this long tail
issue is really, really important. Any LMS design that doesn't take it
very seriously as a core design requirement, IMHO, is not really
addressing the ""L"" the way it needs to be addressed in next-generation
learning environments.

I would add that, from my perspective, this debate also isn't really
about Sakai vs. something else. SUNY has particular needs which favor a
particular implementation strategy. That's a relatively local concern of
one institution. In the biggest picture, SUNY doesn't matter that much.
Neither does Sakai. What matters is that the global community is in the
midst of thinking through next-generation learning environment design.
As John points out, we agree on a lot. But the devil is in the details.

Kindest regards,
Michael

I should chip in her as Dan's PHB :)

Our strategy at Cambridge is to try and get the best of both worlds. I
am dismayed by the either/or tone of many discussions on this topic. If
you start from a monolithic place you will find yourself wanting/needing
to be loosening things up. If you start from a very loosely coupled
place you will find yourself wanting to provide some coordination
(broker service in SUNY plans I think).

Although the Sakai project and the SUNY design (and others) are at
different places on the spectrum I hope we can have conversations that
lead to learning from each other and conversion, or at least an
understanding of when one approach is better than another and when it is
not.

John

PS and from my point of view Dan is free to continue to voice his
opinions. He has had an interesting experience of building a custom LMS
for a multi-departmental course based on Wiki technology before joining
CARET.

But perhaps some of this belongs on the strategy and advocacy list
rather than Dev?

Our strategy at Cambridge is to try and get the best of both worlds. I am
dismayed by the either/or tone of many discussions on this topic. If you
start from a monolithic place you will find yourself wanting/needing to be
loosening things up. If you start from a very loosely coupled place you will
find yourself wanting to provide some coordination (broker service in SUNY
plans I think).

Although the Sakai project and the SUNY design (and others) are at different
places on the spectrum I hope we can have conversations that lead to
learning from each other and conversion, or at least an understanding of
when one approach is better than another and when it is not.

John

PS and from my point of view Dan is free to continue to voice his opinions.
He has had an interesting experience of building a custom LMS for a
multi-departmental course based on Wiki technology before joining CARET.

But perhaps some of this belongs on the strategy and advocacy list rather
than Dev?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/9>","The portlet pulls in the ""worksite"" iframe, so that is a situation where
you would want the refresh to work.  Incidentally, refresh does work in
gallery and portal (full) mode, I believe.

The chat tool exhibits the same behavior in the mercury portal (but that
isn't that surprising).

About the presence issue, it seems there are use cases for logging
in with presence and those for logging in without presence.  Perhaps
the webservices methods should have that option.

If you are using mod_cas, you only need to make the changes to 
httpd.conf, Tomcat, and the login.vm UI as listed. Sakai will use the 
value of REMOTE_USER as the userid. The login.vm changes are optional 
but make it easy for you to still login as ""admin"" if needed.

(For those interested, the xlogin.* properties introduced in 2.0.0+ 
were partially inspired by some of UI work done in conjunction with 
CASification.)

If you want to use a servlet filter, the steps are similar but 
different. I have a 1.5 instance running with a servlet filter, so 
feel free to contact me if you go this way.

Are you starting Tomcat as a service?  Where are the JVM values being set?  I  have seen this problem solved on a Windows 2003 server by setting JVM values in Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables.  Tomcat is installed as a service.

Set JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS to ""-Xmx512M -Xms512M"" (or higher as necessary) under System variables.

I keep getting this memory error after a clean boot and clean install of
2.1 on Windows 2003 server. I have tried various settings as suggested
with the JVM values. I get these errors after about 5-10 clicks on links
after a clean start. Page will tend to be blank in body, I then look at
STD log and see this error.  The server I am running on has 2GB memory.
Any ideas?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/17>","I put up the code in contrib for the VT sakai 2.1 providers during the
conference (sorry for the delay for those who I have talked to about
this).

You can get the code here:
https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/virginiatech/providers/

A quick listing of the providers:
1) One provider to enforce confidentiality of user data by obscuring
part or all of the field from users like other students but allow the
data to be visible to instructors or maintainers in the site
2) One provider to allow for whitelisting or blacklisting users and
assigning them a level of access when they enter the system
3) One provider to handling caching of data from the institutional
repository (database cache and memory cache using ehcache)
4) Two providers to access the VT LDAP as an example (one gets all user
data and one gets only public user data)

The providers work together and talk to each other using spring so that
the parts (like caching) can be easily removed or added. Current
structure is:
WhitelistProvider -> ConfidentialProvider -> CacheProvider ->
LDAPprovider
See the javadocs for more info.

I also put up the whitelist tool which is a tool to add or remove users
from the whitelist and set their level of access. The tool is written
using JSF and hibernate. It requires the WhitelistProvider to be in the
providers dir before it will compile when building sakai.
https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/virginiatech/whitelist/

Feel free to check out this code if any of it sounds helpful (or if you
think you can make it better). I am happy to integrate changes from
others back into the code.

This bug has its root in the different implementations of tar, most

As a practical matter, the messages are simply annoying.

I didn't see this mentioned in JIRA after a quick search, but I apologize 
if this is old news to some of you. During the past week or two I've been 
unable to use the collab site (after login) when I access it with Internet 
Explorer (I believe this happened after Sakai 2.1.0 was installed there). 
The site logs me out immediately after login (perhaps 10 seconds later, 
after choosing the particular Sakai site I want to see), so I have no 
chance of accessing resources or doing anything at all. I'm using IE on 
Windows 2000. I wonder if this is also the experience of other Windows 
users, or whether it is just my particular configuration... I haven't seen 
this problem with other browsers.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/28>","Andrew,

A discussion of helpers in general is located in the following document
on the sakai collab site:
http://collab.sakaiproject.org/access/content/group/1097928811887-22636/
Architecture%20Docs/Sakai%202/sakai_tool.pdf

The trick is to get the helper tool by its Id and call the ""help"" method
on that.  This will cause a forward to happen.  A helper should always
go back to your tool's servlet for each request it needs to make, this
means that your servlet should be helper aware meaning it should know
what requests to forward on to the helper.  The basic syntax is as
follows:

ToolSession toolSession = SessionManager.getCurrentToolSession();
ActiveTool helperTool = ActiveToolManager.getActiveTool(helperId);
// put state info in toolSession to communicate with helper

// this is the forward call
helperTool.help(req, res, context, toolPath);

An example of a servlet that does this is 
org.sakaiproject.tool.syllabus.SyllabusFilePickerServlet

This is a jsf servlet, but the concept should be similar.

When the tool is finished, it will redirect to the URL specified in:

toolSession.setAttribute(helperTool.getId() + Tool.HELPER_DONE_URL, 
returnUrl);

As for the file picker specifically, the attributes necessary to
communicate with it are found in the class:
org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.filepicker.FilePickerHelper

The descriptions should be in the javadocs there.

I hope that helps.  If not, please let me know.

John

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/29>","Manchester Metropolitan is leading the development of a toolkit to 
provide a course service. This work can be found at 
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=elfref_mmu&src=alpha and 
http://www.elframework.org/projects/xcri. The specification is being 
coordinated with U.S. software firms and PESC and SIF. This will become 
one of the JISC services using XML, SOAP, and WSDL. Note this 
specification can answer the course questions, but not the collaboration 
questions, worksite sponsorships, or a general search of metadata which 
may answer ""kayaking"" (unless Kayak was in the name of the worksite 
sponsor).

Someone at the University of Essex may be able to better answer your 
question about collaborations. They are planning work on the use of the 
FOAF (friend of a friend) protocol to identify ""collaborations."" This 
builds on their Chimera project http://www.essex.ac.uk/chimera/index.html.

A collaboration network could be built from course enrollments 
(including sections and projects) and any address the user may have in 
their collaboration tools. Because collaboration is coming from other 
research, a separate collaboration service built on the Chimera work may 
be preferable.

job of stepping in to explain what was going on. The only things I'd add are:

1) You can find an explanation of the new permissions and suggestions for 
upgraders in the file:

gradebook/xdocs/ReleaseNotes-2.1.0.txt

2) As noted there, the 2.1 (and after) equivalents for the 2.0 ""maintain"" 
permission are ""editAssignments"" and ""gradeAll"". This is what course site 
members in the ""instructor"" role should receive by default in 
out-of-the-box Sakai. The ""gradeSection"" permission means that the user can 
only grade students who share a section with them. It's meant for GSIs, 
teaching assistants, and other people who might have grading capabilities 
assigned to them for particular sections of a course site, but not for the 
whole site.

Please avoid making generalized statements like this. There are plenty
of developers building/testing Sakai on Windows without trouble, and
there are even schools in pilots/production on Windows. Sounds like
you failed to give the JVM more perm gen space, which is heavily
documented as something to watch out for (on any platform).

thanks,

Dave

service or not, and I think it was Luke Fernandez who noted that he had
trouble getting suggested JAVA_OPTS settings to work if he set them as an
environment variable rather than through the Tomcat properties GUI.  As Dave
notes, this does sound like a permanent generation problem.

Our Windows install documentation is however admittedly weak, and could use
more input from those people actually working with it out there.  If some
clear resolution of this can be achieved, a comment somewhere in:

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/34>","Thanks for the response.  But perhaps I should provide some scope to my
question.  I am talking more in terms of:  given an out-of-the-box
installation of sakai, what would I have to implement in order to:

1. identify a worksite as being a ""course"" or a ""collaboration"" or a ""hoe
down"" or a ""singles mixer"" or any other arbitrary classification.

2. sort worksites according to those classifications, hopefully with some
notion of hierachy.

3. access this information in order to use it to provide navigational
structure or cues.

The use case is reimplementing the site navigation so that a user can more
easily navigate to ""My Photography course"", ""My research group's
Retigeranic Acid Synthesis discussion group"", ""The Chess Club"", ""The
Campus Campaign to Rename Utah"" without having to scroll through a list of
say 30 (or 300) worksites that they are a member of.  Rather they would
select ""My Research -> Retigeranic Acid Sythesis"" or ""My Clubs ->
Political -> Campaign to Rename Utah"".

Our focus right now is on ""ad hoc"" collaborations and not courses,
although that will follow.

If this is not possible, should it be?

You can create any type of worksite you want. The Admin Sites tool has a 
field for site type - if you were to type something in there other than 
course or project, you'd then have a new type. But to have that type be 
presented as a selection in Worksite setup when you choose at the 
beginning what type of site you want to create, you need to edit the 
sakai.sitesetup.xml file (at 
/trunk/sakai/legacy/tools/src/webapp/tools/sakai.sitesetup.xml) and add 
the new type.

Then you would also need to edit tool registration files to add that new 
type, so that a given tool shows up as one that can be selected to 
include in that type of site when it is created.

There are some notes (just ppt slides at this point) in this 
presentation that may help.
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/download/attachments/9638/Configuring+Sakai+Austin.ppt

Then to sort, each user in their My Workspace can use the Worksite Setup 
tool to sort their list of sites by type.

There has been talk of implementing a hierarchy in Sakai that would be 
useful in navigating through sites.. I'm not sure if it would help in 
navigating through types of sites though.

the Oracle JSF team (who have always seemed like good guys) announced in 
Antwerp today that they've gotten permission to donate the library to MyFaces:

Central capability required is to embed info specifying the ""URL stub""
that will be passed to a tool as specifying its navigation state into
the global Sakai portal URL - I presume this will be done via 
URL-encoding the entire stub with some attribute name that identifies
the tool instance somehow...

I'd like to get info on global portal URL generation in general - 
I read ominous threats at some point that this had been generified
and that we could no longer always depend on the expected
address/ site / page structure - where is the code which operates
this?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/43>","It appears that the only way to access entity objects is via a valid reference object/string for that entity.  Currently, you are not able to get a list of all entities, or entities with certain properties from an EntityProducer.  As a result, I am still forced to grab a list of specific objects from a specific service, such as Assignment objects from the AssignmentService.  Only then can I use them as entities.  Thus my tool is dependent on specific services.

Alternatively (I am making some assumptions here), I can create a helper tool that other tools use or add a dependency to my service within other services in order to pass entity references.  Now that my service has these references, I can use them to grab entities without dependency on other services.  This alternative, however, forces other tools to use my service/helper.

Is there a way to pass references without creating these dependencies?  If not, should there be, or are there other considerations?

It is nice to see most of you in Austin during the Sakai conference. It 
was a wonderful and successful conference.
Well, we encountered a problem to upgrade to Sakai2.1from v2.0.1. 

The procedure we did:
1. Renamed sakai-src as ""sakai-src-bak"".
2, DLL sakai2.1 source as sakai-src.
3. Remove .maven/repository.
4. Did ""maven clean""
5. Built successful
6. start tomcat, we got this error:
(should mention 2 things: 
-   we use MySQL database and as suggested, using mysql-connector 
v3.1.12 instead of v3.1.11
-   we manually modified 
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource = 
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED""  )

It is nice to see most of you in Austin during the Sakai conference. It 
was a wonderful and successful conference.
Well, we encountered a problem to upgrade to Sakai2.1from v2.0.1. 

The procedure we did:
1. Renamed sakai-src as ""sakai-src-bak"".
2, DLL sakai2.1 source as sakai-src.
3. Remove .maven/repository.
4. Did ""maven clean""
5. Built successful
6. start tomcat, we got this error:
(should mention 2 things: 
-   we use MySQL database and as suggested, using mysql-connector 
v3.1.12 instead of v3.1.11
-   we manually modified 
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource = 
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED""  )

Syllabus (and Samingo), which I've reproduced in both Sakai 2.0.1/=20
mysql and Sakai 2.1/mysql. The problem does not exist with HySqlDb. I =20
have my suspicions that the problem has something to do with =20
hibernate, but I haven't had the time to completely debug the =20
problem. UTF-8 Characters entered into the Syllbus (e.g. title) are =20
rendered at question marks (""??"") after the changes have been saved =20
in MySql. Has anyone else duplicated this problem and/or have any =20
insight into it's cause?

I noticed that JIRA SAK-116  reports this problem is fixed with =20
Oracle by applying the self-described kludge of r3807, but this patch =20
does not affect the problem with MySql.

I've included in this message a thread regarding other UTF-8 problems =20
in 2.0.1/mysql that appear to have been resolved in Sakai 2.1. In =20
case these problems have a common cause, does anyone know what was =20
done to resolve the problems mentioned below in Mike's email?

Thanks,

I have been looking at the SectionManager API and other section-related 
API's. I noticed that the addSection() .. method description mentions 
that this adds a section to a parent course section.

What is the method that is responsible for adding sections to a site ?  
addSection() method seems to me that it would need that a CourseSection 
to already exist before further sections can be added.

Suppose I create a site as follows

SiteEdit siteEdit = SiteService.addSite(compositeSiteId);

This returns a siteEdit object that represents a course site/project site.

Is there any section - related methods that I can then call on this 
siteEdit object , so that I can begin to add sections to this 
course/project site that I have created. The current methods in the 
SectionManager API's do not seem to have any methods that can perform 
this function.

Any suggestions on how to go about this would be highly invaluable.

I am wondering if Sakai developers considering to implement ""password
forgotten"" feature like it in many other sites, e.g. Yahoo groups. When
the user click on the ""Password forgotten"" link, Sakai will send a copy
of the user's password to this user's email account. This feature prove
to be helpful tool for Sakai/sites administrators. It will be so much
easier to administering a site.

Anyone have any ideas where I may find some sample codes if I want to
try to code myself?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/53>","Hi Vishwak,
I want to provide a little background here for everyone other than you 
and me:  UC Merced has chosen to expose an API that, by default, is not 
exposed in the shared Component Manager.  This API, called 
SectionManager, allows a caller to manipulate sections in sakai from any 
webapp, web service, etc.  The API is deliberately not exposed because 
we anticipate that it will either be removed in the next version of 
sakai, or it will be so radically changed that it will essentially be a 
different API.  However, UC Merced wants to populate their sections via 
webservices (if I recall), so they want to expose the API... knowing 
full well that their work in this area may be rendered obsolete in the 
next version of sakai.

OK, so with that said...

SectionManager intentionally knows nothing of sakai APIs, so that the 
tool can be dropped into sakai, or operate as a standalone tool to 
support standalone gradebook and samigo... hence, you don't see the 
usual reference to Site, SiteEdit, etc in the API.  As you know, to add 
a section you call the following method:

public CourseSection addSection(String courseUuid, String title,
String category, Integer maxEnrollments, String location,
Time startTime, Time endTime,
boolean monday, boolean tuesday, boolean wednesday, boolean 
thursday,
boolean friday, boolean saturday, boolean sunday);

The javadocs on this method are not particularly helpful, especially 
when approaching the use of the API from a ""sakai perspective"".  The 
""courseUuid"", which is the first parameter of the method call, is in 
fact the site reference.  So you don't even need to get a SiteEdit 
object.  Just get your current context, and use the SiteService to 
obtain the site's reference.  Something like this:

public static final String getSiteReference() {
Placement placement = ToolManager.getCurrentPlacement();
String context = placement.getContext();
return SiteService.siteReference(context);
}

Hope that helps,
Josh

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/49>","The unicode string is corrupted within the mysql database. Here's the =20
nitty-gritty on what I've been able to discover so far:

1. When =20
org.sakaiproject.component.app.syllabus.SyllabusDataImpl.setTitle() =20
is called from the JSF code (i.e. immediately after input from the =20
form), the unicode is correct
2. But this same setTitle() method is next invoked from hibernate, =20
and this time it is garbage:

http-8080-Processor24[1] dump title
title =3D ""??""
http-8080-Processor24[1] where
[1] =20
org.sakaiproject.component.app.syllabus.SyllabusDataImpl.setTitle =20
(SyllabusDataImpl.java:91)
[2] org.sakaiproject.component.app.syllabus.SyllabusDataImpl$=20

It is nice to see most of you in Austin during the Sakai conference. It 
was a wonderful and successful conference.
Well, we encountered a problem to upgrade to Sakai2.1from v2.0.1. 

The procedure we did:
1. Renamed sakai-src as ""sakai-src-bak"".
2, DLL sakai2.1 source as sakai-src.
3. Remove .maven/repository.
4. Did ""maven clean""
5. Built successful
6. start tomcat, we got this error:
(should mention 2 things: 
-   we use MySQL database and as suggested, using mysql-connector 
v3.1.12 instead of v3.1.11
-   we manually modified 
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource = 
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED""  )

Could you check how the string looks like inside MySQL? I've found several
places where character encoding is not preserved, but none at database leve=
l;
Assuming that there's a utf setting everywhere (tomcat connectors, db, apac=
he,
file system).

There are several places where strings, titles and resource names are encod=
ed,=20
and in some places the encoding may behave as if it was only ascii; just a
guess, from what I've found in 1.0 and 2.0. The strings are already messed
when they reach the database. In 1.0 there was one vm template doing an
unecessary encoding when rendering.

Why only with a database and not with in-memory? there could be some place =
where
encoding of ', "" and other nasty db characters takes place, and only ascii
characters are respected. So, hibernate could have something to do with tha=
t,
or more likely the db storage manager. Alternatively, something goes wrong
when sakai fetches the information out of the db and does the necessary=20
encodings.

I hope that helps; that's the direction we are investigating right now.
Feliz

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/63>","Hello,

We are a group of students at the university of Massachusetts developing a
Sakai tool for a software engineering course. We are attempting to extend
the presence tool to allow instant messaging but we are somewhat confused
about virtual path mappings within Sakai.
We modify the presence tool to have links for each name that will eventually
pop a window containing a JSP page. We do not understand however where to
place our JSP files or where to define their location.
Usually we use servlet-mapping to map the tool URL in web.xml, however the
presence tool seems to be somewhat different in its implementation. Would
anyone be able to shed some light on this issue or point us towards any
relevant documentation?

Thank you very much!

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/66>","An email password feature (even if it had to email a newly generated password) might actually facilitate first time logins for SIS-Sakai integrations that aren't pre-populating the password in Sakai accounts.  This seems to be my predicament.   I'm using Stephen Githen's excellent Web services to perform SIS-Sakai integration and I'm using it to populate all of the important SIS data except the student's SIS password which is available in the SIS only as a hash. I can't populate Sakai created accounts with an SIS password using SakaiScript.addnewuser because the password parameter in SakaiScript.addnewuser, as far as I can tell, is only designed to accept a non-hashed version of the SIS password.    

I can still get first time users logged into Sakai by having them authenticate through our portal and then running the SakaiPortalLogin Web service.  But with an email password feature students wouldn't have to go through the portal the first time they log in -- they could get a generated password through the e-mail feature.

Alternatively, maybe Stephen's SakaiScript.addNewUser could store the SIS hashed password directly....rather than hashing it again (which is what I'm guessing Sakai does although maybe I'm totally off-base here).  

Cheers,

If I set:

I don't know that this is your issue, but just to answer this specific
question: it will be configured in apache's conf directory somewhere, either
in httpd.conf, or in mod_jk.conf (preferred).  You'll need settings that
look something like:

JkMount /* ajp13
#JkMount  /portal/* ajp13
#JkMount /dav/* ajp13
#JkMount /access/* ajp13

That first line is just for handing everything from Apache to Tomcat,
including dav.  The commented ones are for doing crazy things like trying to
hand only certain things to Tomcat, and have Apache handle the rest - like
we did.

We currently have a tool using the myfaces-all-1.1.1.jar library running in Sakai 2.1.  I haven't tried with the individual libraries, but I assume they would work as well.

I can't comment on your second question, but I would be interested to know how different versions of MyFaces could break Sakai.

Hi,

Have anyone successfully built a tool in Sakai 2.1 using MyFaces 1.1.1? 
I found that Sakai only supports MyFaces 1.0.9 which is a quite buggy 
version of some JSF components.

Would it be a bug if Sakai only works fine with MyFaces 1.1.1?  Should I 
file it in Jira?

Ken

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/76>","Any ""password forgotten"" feature would be implementation and local policy
dependent.  Perhaps Sakai should have a simple interface and example using
the internal database, and leave it to local installations to implement
one according to their local desires and policies.  I think it should be
separate from the authentication interfaces, since it really doesn't have
anything to do with authentication (it has to do with communicating with a
backend service which happens to do authentication).

The implementation for SSO could be simply to refer them to whatever
mechanisms the local SSO provider has in place...

This seems to be my predicament.   I'm using Stephen Githen's excellent Web services to perform SIS-Sakai integration and I'm using it to populate all of the important SIS data except the student's SIS password which is available in the SIS only as a hash. I can't populate Sakai created accounts with an SIS password using SakaiScript.addnewuser because the password parameter in SakaiScript.addnewuser, as far as I can tell, is only designed to accept a non-hashed version of the SIS password.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/60>","Hi,

Have anyone successfully built a tool in Sakai 2.1 using MyFaces 1.1.1? 
I found that Sakai only supports MyFaces 1.0.9 which is a quite buggy 
version of some JSF components.

Would it be a bug if Sakai only works fine with MyFaces 1.1.1?  Should I 
file it in Jira?

Ken

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/89>","Hi,

This was a good start (good detective work!), but it did not clear up =20
all our problems with this issue.

I found that this line was incorrect in my sakai.properties file, but =20
upon correcting it, restarting Sakai, and re-uploading the file, I =20
still have troubles.

I uploaded a MS Word doc called ""F=F8r=E9ign Ch=E0r=E0ct=EAr T=EBst.doc"" in=
to =20
resources. It uploads fine and does not kill Sakai (as in the past). =20
However, upon downloading the file, the name has been changed to ""ign =20
Cha9ra9cte_r TeAst.doc"".

The attached screenshot shows how the file upload appears correctly =20
in the display, but the record in the XML field of my MySQL db =20
content_resource table confirms this mangling:

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/79>","When one adds a guest user as site participant in Worksite Setup, if  
the guest user is unknown, it gets added into Sakai with a random  
password.

There is a setting in sakai.properties, notifyNewUserEmail, to  
control sending notification email. If the setting is true or  
missing, an email with the random password will be sent to the guest  
user. He can then use this password to login for the first time.

Maybe we should add this feature into Admin's Users tool, so that  
notification email will be sent when an guest account is added there.

if this could be a self-service feature of the gateway.

I'm willing to take a stab at writing a tool to do this but I think
Rutgers or someone else may have already done so.

I'll send it to you in a separate email. Are you able to get at any docs in
the Sakai Development Resources, or is it just this one causing problems?
What browser are you using? I was able to get at the doc via the URL below,
so would like to track down what the problem might be.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/93>","It appears that with Windows installations you should manage the JVM
settings via the Tomcat UI in the systray as opposed to the JAVA_OPTS
environment setting.

In two separate installs the JAVA_OPTS settings appeared to have no
effect on the memory errors no matter how much I adjusted the settings
up or down. Once I added the values to the Java tab on the Tomcat GUI,
restarted Tomcat problems disappeared.

Subject: Re: Memory error with 2.1

Windows installations can be complicated by whether they're installed as
a service or not, and I think it was Luke Fernandez who noted that he
had trouble getting suggested JAVA_OPTS settings to work if he set them
as an environment variable rather than through the Tomcat properties
GUI.  As Dave notes, this does sound like a permanent generation
problem.

Our Windows install documentation is however admittedly weak, and could
use more input from those people actually working with it out there.  If
some clear resolution of this can be achieved, a comment somewhere in:
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=885
1

... would be much appreciated.

Yes. Rutgers did this for 2.0 because ""Our help desk has no way to 
identify guests. Since guests are identified by email address, the 
only practical approach is to use an email exchange. Create a ""change 
my password"" button. It mails a magic token that logins in the guest 
and lets him change his password.""

It works pretty well.

More details are at:

http://rulink.rutgers.edu/sakai

Someone from Rutgers will have to give you the details on the current 
status of the code. In the meantime, I think we should consider this 
for inclusion in the main code base, with a configurable on/off 
setting in sakai.properties.

address). The user clicks the link and comes back to a ""change password""
page in the system with ""new password"" and ""confirm new password"".

This is (IMHO) a far more secure means of dealing with forgotten passwords,
as no passwords are visible and the ""reset password"" URL is single-use only.

Of course, with more widespread adoption of single sign on, the emphasis
changes somewhat...

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/69>","I'm only running Sakai 2.1 at the moment. I mentioned that I had had 2.0.1
on the same server because I suspect something in 2.1 rather than the
server. Sorry for the confusion. I can also webdav with
http://sakai-stable.mit.edu:8030/portal, so I don't think the problem is
with my PC. I don't think it is a problem with usernames either, as I have
the same user on my PC as on Sakai 2.1.

My installation of 2.1 is now using MySQL. I had been using Oracle but had a
few other problems which using MySQL has cured, no more locks, but not
webdav.

I'd be grateful if anyone can suggest anything else to try. Has anyone else
had rpoblems with 2.1 and webdav?

Jon,

You mentioned having two sakai installations in the same server? running at
the same time?

Do you see something unsual in the $TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.out logs?

The locking behavior seems unsual, although it should not interfere with
webdav.

I'm sorry but I can't remember anything else to try...

I've got both of them (and 6 more) on a semi-crappy iSight recording  
(that is - Quicktime Movie weighing about 100 mb each).

You can browse them here...
http://130.226.196.228/SakaiWinter2005Conference.html

I'll get them into confluence given some time...

Kind regards,

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/95>","To Charles and Sakai Collab Group:

I designed a Telemedicine course (for an Instructor at UCDHS) and uploaded it on Sakai via the 'Resources' tab.  The course was built on MS Producer realizing that  'Melete' Course Builder is not able to handle a bundle of different files to enable the seamless loading of the course.  The problem with putting it on the 'Resources' directory is that when a user (learner) logs in, all the other subfiles also appear within the same window making it necessary for the user to scroll through multiple files just to find the major course file.  At its current condition this method is cumbersome and would prefer that a user simply goes to a Module or Course tab and be able to click the Telemedicine course, with the course loading instantly (without subfiles appearing which by the way at its current state could be moved, deleted or modified by anyone having access).

Any suggestions?  Is there another tool I can use?  Does sakai have this capability built in already which I'm unaware of?  Thanks and I appreciate your help.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/91>","Never mind, then.  Since the Apache question came up, I'd guessed you were
using Apache's basic web server and connecting it to Tomcat for the
application serving, but now it sounds like you're just going to Tomcat
directly, and not putting an additional web server in front.

It doesn't help that Tomcat changed its directory naming scheme with
5.5.12to include Apache in the title.  Sorry to help confuse things
further.
mod_jk is a red herring for your problem.

2 sakai.properties file under kernel config.
Which sakai.properties file is maven really executable and really take 
a look?

Clay
Thank you for your response. Yes, we removed placeholder.properties file 
and moved all the content in the placeholder.properties into 
sakai.properties.Unfortunatly we still got the same error. 

Thanks

Error to run Sakai 2.1 with MySQL





Hello, Everyone
It is nice to see most of you in Austin during the Sakai conference. It 
was a wonderful and successful conference.
Well, we encountered a problem to upgrade to Sakai2.1from v2.0.1. 

The procedure we did:
1. Renamed sakai-src as ""sakai-src-bak"".
2, DLL sakai2.1 source as sakai-src.
3. Remove .maven/repository.
4. Did ""maven clean""
5. Built successful
6. start tomcat, we got this error:
(should mention 2 things: 
-   we use MySQL database and as suggested, using mysql-connector 
v3.1.12 instead of v3.1.11
-   we manually modified 
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource = 
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED""  )

Actually we tried all mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar, 3.1.11 and 
3.1.12. None of them worked. 

Do you know what the error message means? What did it complain about?

We also checked all sakai.properties file and ensured all setting with 
MySQL instead of HSQL.

Any thoughts?

Re: Error to run Sakai 2.1 with MySQL






Grace,

I used your setting ""
defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource 
= TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED"" with mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar 
instead of 3.1.12. And I don't have the error messages.

Is there a reason to use 3.1.12 instead of 3.1.10? I know 3.1.10 has been 
working for a while.

Thanks,

- Zhen

Thank you for your response. Yes, we removed placeholder.properties file 
and moved all the content in the placeholder.properties into 
sakai.properties.Unfortunatly we still got the same error.

Error to run Sakai 2.1 with MySQL





Hello, Everyone
It is nice to see most of you in Austin during the Sakai conference. It 
was a wonderful and successful conference.
Well, we encountered a problem to upgrade to Sakai2.1from v2.0.1. 

The procedure we did:
1. Renamed sakai-src as ""sakai-src-bak"".
2, DLL sakai2.1 source as sakai-src.
3. Remove .maven/repository.
4. Did ""maven clean""
5. Built successful
6. start tomcat, we got this error:
(should mention 2 things: 
-   we use MySQL database and as suggested, using mysql-connector 
v3.1.12 instead of v3.1.11
-   we manually modified 
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource = 
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED""  )

Re: Error to run Sakai 2.1 with MySQL






Well,  it was complaining about property 
'defaultTransactionIsolationString' of javax.sql.BaseDataSource is not 
writable or has a invalid setter method.
However, according to definition of the bean,


<!-- Use TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED for MySQL -->
<!-- DO NOT SET for Oracle (the default TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED is 
fine, and setting it causes performance problems) -->
<!-- Up to and including 1.7.1, HSQLDB supports only 
Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED. -->
<property name=""defaultTransactionIsolationString"">
<value>TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED</value>
</property>

defaultTransactionIsolationString should have a proper setter and getter, 
and TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED should be a proper value.

I used to use 
""jdbc.defaultTransactionIsolation=java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED"" 
in my sakai.properties, and it still works.

Thanks,

- Zhen

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/96>","Grace,

I used your setting  
""defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource =  
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED"" with mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar  
instead of 3.1.12. And I don't have the error messages.

Is there a reason to use 3.1.12 instead of 3.1.10? I know 3.1.10 has  
been working for a while.

Thanks,

- Zhen

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/99>","The Sakai 2.2. schedule is really very approximate at this point, but  
here is a rough plan of timing.

The OSP project is expecting to do a release of Sakai+OSP sometime in  
the Feb-Mar timeframe.  We hope that this uses the Sakai maintenance  
branch rather than requiring a full release of Sakai.

If the OSP release goes to plan, the next Sakai release will be the  
2.2 release and is roughly targetted for code-freeze May 15 and  
Delivery July 15.

These dates may change as new issues come up, but the high level view  
is that we have 5-6 months until the next signficant Sakai release.

For tool developers and Sakai deployers the 2.2 release will be  
evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  The ""difference"" will be on  
the order of the difference between 2.0 and 2.1.  Some things will  
change but we will avoid anything that would require major rewrites  
of your tools, services, web service code, or providers.

For those Fall deployers who need lots of time, we hope to be nearly  
feature and schema frozen by May 15 - you will be able to take a tag  
of Sakai at that time to begin your 2.2 work.

As always - this is always subject to change based on how things go  
in the community and as issues come up.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/100>","Well,  it was complaining about property  
'defaultTransactionIsolationString' of javax.sql.BaseDataSource is  
not writable or has a invalid setter method.
However, according to definition of the bean,


<!-- Use TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED for MySQL -->
<!-- DO NOT SET for Oracle (the default  
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED is fine, and setting it causes performance  
problems) -->
<!-- Up to and including 1.7.1, HSQLDB supports only  
Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED. -->
<property name=""defaultTransactionIsolationString"">
<value>TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED</value>
</property>

defaultTransactionIsolationString should have a proper setter and  
getter, and TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED should be a proper value.

I used to use  
""jdbc.defaultTransactionIsolation=java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_C 
OMMITTED"" in my sakai.properties, and it still works.

Thanks,

May I suggest that a support aliases or two be set up for this kind of 
thing? Something like collab-help@sakaiproject.org that reflects out 
to a set of the right people?

It would be a lot easier that remembering to send mail to Glenn about 
your account and one of the above three for sites.

Are you sure? According to Glenn's late-November message announcing 
this change:

""Note this is different from prior versions:

jdbc.defaultTransactionIsolation=java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED

This old value will NO LONGER WORK.""

This is change is tracked in SAK-2909 for those following at home.

conf file, and as far as I can see never have although I did have webdav
working with sakai 2.0.1. I have used a fresh Tomcat for Sakai 2.1, however,
the conf directory for 2.1 looks pretty much the same as 2.0.1. The only
thing from Apache I've ever installed was Tomcat 5.5.9 and a Sakai plugin
for it, and web searches for mod_jk.conf mentions communications between
Apache and Tomcat and that it be placed in Apache/conf directory, whereas I
only have a jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/conf. 

Should I have this file, or have downloaded it, or do I need to download it?
Sorry, I don't know what to do next.

I don't know that this is your issue, but just to answer this specific
question: it will be configured in apache's conf directory somewhere, either
in httpd.conf, or in mod_jk.conf (preferred).  You'll need settings that
look something like:

JkMount /* ajp13
#JkMount  /portal/* ajp13
#JkMount /dav/* ajp13
#JkMount /access/* ajp13

That first line is just for handing everything from Apache to Tomcat,
including dav.  The commented ones are for doing crazy things like trying to
hand only certain things to Tomcat, and have Apache handle the rest - like
we did.

Subject: Sakai 2.2 Schedule - High level
To: sakai-dev <sakai-dev@collab.sakaiproject.org>

The Sakai 2.2. schedule is really very approximate at this point, but
here is a rough plan of timing.

The OSP project is expecting to do a release of Sakai+OSP sometime in
the Feb-Mar timeframe.  We hope that this uses the Sakai maintenance
branch rather than requiring a full release of Sakai.

If the OSP release goes to plan, the next Sakai release will be the
2.2 release and is roughly targetted for code-freeze May 15 and
Delivery July 15.

These dates may change as new issues come up, but the high level view
is that we have 5-6 months until the next signficant Sakai release.

For tool developers and Sakai deployers the 2.2 release will be
evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  The ""difference"" will be on
the order of the difference between 2.0 and 2.1.  Some things will
change but we will avoid anything that would require major rewrites
of your tools, services, web service code, or providers.

For those Fall deployers who need lots of time, we hope to be nearly
feature and schema frozen by May 15 - you will be able to take a tag
of Sakai at that time to begin your 2.2 work.

As always - this is always subject to change based on how things go
in the community and as issues come up.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/108>","I think the problem here is shown in this error message (see below) -  
note the class it is attempting to set.  This is not correct, since  
for Sakai 2.1 we use a different DataSource class.  I'm not sure how  
you have ended up with this situation; perhaps from customizations to  
the kernel's sakai.properties, perhaps a bad mixing of 2.0 and 2.1  
runtime artifacts.

The file in sakai/kernel/db-components/src/webapp/WEB-INF/ 
components.xml is where the DataSource is declared in Sakai.  It  
reads like this:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC ""-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"" ""http:// 
www.springkernel.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd"">

<beans>

<!-- Base DataSource for all pooled database connections -->
<!-- See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/configuration.html  
-->
<bean id=""javax.sql.BaseDataSource"" abstract=""true""
class=""org.apache.commons.dbcp.SakaiBasicDataSource""
destroy-method=""close"">

Note the class is a Sakai one, SakaiBasicDataSource, not the Apache  
one, BasicDataSource.  Somehow in your runtime, the older definition  
still seems to be in play - otherwise the error message would have read:

'defaultTransactionIsolationString' of bean class  
[org.apache.commons.dbcp. SakaiBasicDataSource]: Bean...

I recommend the following.  Install a clean new Tomcat, so you have  
no chance of having some Sakai 2.0 jars or wars lying around.  Make  
sure you are using completely unmodified Sakai source.  Clean your  
maven repo (again).  Build, deploy, and put in place your  
sakai.properties with your proper MySQL settings, etc.

At this point, there's no way you can get a message like below.

Could someone point me to any document's or discussions about strategies

reference to the part of the architecture overview where there is a

There is work going on right now between OSP and the Resources tool

Thanks for the tip.  I wanted to find out whom I should e-mail about
my collab account and haven't been able to discover this from collab
itself, www.sakaiproject.org, Sakaipedia, or the Indiana Knowledge
Base.

A note on https://www.indiana.edu/~sakaikb/display.cgi?docid=apjk
suggests ""you can use the Sakai site's Contact us link on the left at:
http://www.sakaiproject.org/"" but when I went to that web form it
wasn't clear what category to select for the message.  (Do I select
""Technical-User Support"", ""WebSite"", or something else?  Or does it
even matter - do the messages all go to the same person/people?)  I
was put off by the list of categories, but if one were added for
issues relating to collab, I would be happy to use the web form.

Re: Error to run Sakai 2.1 with MySQL






I think the problem here is shown in this error message (see below) - note 
the class it is attempting to set.  This is not correct, since for Sakai 
2.1 we use a different DataSource class.  I'm not sure how you have ended 
up with this situation; perhaps from customizations to the kernel's 
sakai.properties, perhaps a bad mixing of 2.0 and 2.1 runtime artifacts.

The file in sakai/kernel/db-components/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml 
is where the DataSource is declared in Sakai.  It reads like this:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC ""-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"" ""
http://www.springkernel.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd"">

<beans>

<!-- Base DataSource for all pooled database connections -->
<!-- See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/configuration.html -->
<bean id=""javax.sql.BaseDataSource"" abstract=""true""
class=""org.apache.commons.dbcp.SakaiBasicDataSource""
destroy-method=""close"">

Note the class is a Sakai one, SakaiBasicDataSource, not the Apache one, 
BasicDataSource.  Somehow in your runtime, the older definition still 
seems to be in play - otherwise the error message would have read:

'defaultTransactionIsolationString' of bean class 
[org.apache.commons.dbcp. SakaiBasicDataSource]: Bean...

I recommend the following.  Install a clean new Tomcat, so you have no 
chance of having some Sakai 2.0 jars or wars lying around.  Make sure you 
are using completely unmodified Sakai source.  Clean your maven repo 
(again).  Build, deploy, and put in place your sakai.properties with your 
proper MySQL settings, etc.

At this point, there's no way you can get a message like below.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/119>","Did you happen to read my message from Dec 13?  In it, I explained that:

""UC Merced has chosen to expose an API that, by default, is not exposed 
in the shared Component Manager... The API is deliberately not exposed 
because we anticipate that it will either be removed in the next version 
of sakai, or it will be so radically changed that it will essentially be 
a different API.""

The SectionManager API can be exposed by uncommenting the SectionManager 
bean definition in its components.xml.  We don't recommend this (see 
above), but it will allow you to proceed with approach #1 as you've 
described it.

The course was built on MS Producer realizing that  'Melete' Course Builder is not able to handle a bundle of different files to enable the seamless loading of the course.  The problem with putting it on the 'Resources' directory is that when a user (learner) logs in, all the other subfiles also appear within the same window making it necessary for the user to scroll through multiple files just to find the major course file.  At its current condition this method is cumbersome and would prefer that a user simply goes to a Module or Course tab and be able to click the Telemedicine course, with the course loading instantly (without subfiles appearing which by the way at its current state could be moved, deleted or modified by anyone having access).

I don't know what format MS Producer is producing, but if it's a set of 
HTML files with its own navigation structure, you can just add a Web 
Content tool pointing to the index page inside the Resources collection 
(e.g. a URL like /access/content/group/siteid/module1/index.html).

Thanks again. The problem has been solved.
But the issue is even after we cleaned Tomcat, the problem was still 
there. We also removed maven\repository directory as suggested. Then we 
found under maven\cache, there are two directories: one is sakai-2.0 and 
another is sakai-2.1. Somehow, when maven runs, it picked up information 
from sakai-2.0 instead of sakai-2.1. After we manually deleted 
maven\cache\sakai-2.0. Re-built, it works.

Is it something we should document into installation Guide? It only 
mentioned to remove maven\repository directory, not mention remove 
maven\cache\sakai-2.0 if doing upgrade.

Regards
Grace

You probably need to go into your Sakai installation at:

sakai/components/sakai-sections-shared-foo-something/components.xml

and uncomment the <bean> entry for SectionManager and restart Sakai.

This happens if you try to compile/deploy Sakai with the 1.5 JDK, 
something that is NOT ""officially"" recommended. For the moment, you 
MUST use 1.4.2 to get full functionality. I think this is noted in the 
release docs but I guess it could be more prominent.

The transition to 1.5 will happen at some point, but there are a few 
issues including this one; it was described by Glenn noted back in a 
November message:

""This is an interesting change in the Java language.  Comparable in 
1.4 defines compareTo(Object), but in 1.5, it is now:

Comparable<String>

Not just Comparable - and instead of the type-generic Object, it needs 
a String.""

The entire contents of Glenn's November message pushed into this 
JIRA item. It is available at:

http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-3174

Of course, there are those who like to run Sakai under 1.5 -- myself 
included. My preliminary tests show that you can do it with 2.1.0, BUT 
it requires you to give up Section Info functionality and make one 
small change to some Samigo code. Feel free to contact me if you would 
like a copy of the message I sent about this to sakai-dev in November.

Thanks, but I'm now more confused than before. I don't appear to have either
conf file, and as far as I can see never have although I did have webdav
working with sakai 2.0.1. I have used a fresh Tomcat for Sakai 2.1, however,
the conf directory for 2.1 looks pretty much the same as 2.0.1. The only
thing from Apache I've ever installed was Tomcat 5.5.9 and a Sakai plugin
for it, and web searches for mod_jk.conf mentions communications between
Apache and Tomcat and that it be placed in Apache/conf directory, whereas I
only have a jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/conf. 

Should I have this file, or have downloaded it, or do I need to download it?
Sorry, I don't know what to do next.

I don't know that this is your issue, but just to answer this specific
question: it will be configured in apache's conf directory somewhere, either
in httpd.conf, or in mod_jk.conf (preferred).  You'll need settings that
look something like:

JkMount /* ajp13
#JkMount  /portal/* ajp13
#JkMount /dav/* ajp13
#JkMount /access/* ajp13

That first line is just for handing everything from Apache to Tomcat,
including dav.  The commented ones are for doing crazy things like trying to
hand only certain things to Tomcat, and have Apache handle the rest - like
we did.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/124>","I see that there's a new feature that allows deployers to ""stealth"" 
tools without needing to edit each tool's registration file.

(in sakai.properties, add 
""stealthTools@org.sakaiproject.api.kernel.tool.ActiveToolManager=toolId1,toolId2,etc"")

I'm wondering if this should also stealth the help documentation for 
these tools?  If a tool is hidden from view, shouldn't the help for that 
tool also be hidden to minimize confusion for the majority of site 
maintainers who don't have the option of evaluating the tool?  I'm not 
sure whether to add this as a feature request, so I wanted to get some 
input from the community.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/122>","I was interested to hear if anyone has had success running Sakai on  
Oracle's Express Edition.   Oracle XE is a small-footprint version of  
the 10g database engine which is available as a free download.  It is  
limited to one CPU, up to 1 GB ram, and database sizes up to 4 GB.   
The installation process is pretty much a one click 15 minute  
experience, much more simple than installing 10g Standard Edition.   
Of course with its limitations its not of much use to production  
environments, but it could be useful for demos and developers who  
need to get a quick, simple Oracle instance up for development and  
testing.

I made an attempt to start Sakai against a fresh install of XE and  
ran across some issues with connection pooling.  It appears that XE  
is enforcing a limit on concurrent sessions which Sakai runs into  
half way through startup.  I'm still experimenting with settings on  
both Oracle and Sakai to see if I can make this work, but wanted to  
inquire with the community to see if anyone else was working on this.

If you'd like to download Oracle XE for Windows or Linux, you can do  
so here:

During the last QA process, Clay and I asked that a new URL be set up 
to always point to the ""release area."" It was meant to be 
semi-permanent, easy to remember, and convenient for all types of 
users. Check it out by pointing your favorite Web browser to:

http://www.sakaiproject.org/release

You'll be redirected to the appropriate place.

Now, the same has been done for JIRA and Confluence. If you go to:

http://www.sakaiproject.org/jira
http://www.sakaiproject.org/confluence

you will be redirected to the right place. In addition, if you go to:

http://www.sakaiproject.org/bugs

you will find yourself at the top of the bugs.sakaiproject.org server. 
You can navigate to JIRA and Confluence from there as well.

A note of caution: these are only top-level redirects. To go straight 
to a specific issue or confluence space, you have to use the existing 
URLs.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/117>","Hi All,

I am currently implementing a Quartz Job to synchronize an internal DB 
with the Sakai DB (users, sites, sections,...) through the Sakai API.
Everything synchronizes ok except for the section tasks as I am having 
trouble accessing the SectionManager API (I have read the lattest 
discussion on SectionManager)
I tried with the following approaches while attempting access to the 
SessionManager object:
1) SectionManager sm = (SectionManager) 
ComponentManager.get(""org.sakaiproject.api.section.SectionManager""); // 
as suggested by Steven Githens and Josh Holtzman
2) SectionManager sm = new SectionManagerImpl(); // the 
implementation class, not the preferable way...

Both compiled ok with Maven but revealed unsuccessful to me at runtime:
Approach 1) returned me:
WARN: get(org.sakaiproject.api.section.SectionManager): 
org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean 
named 'org.sakaiproject.api.section.SectionManager' is defined
Approach 2) returned me:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/sakaiproject/component/section/sakai21/SectionManagerImpl

I've configured project.xml in order to resolve the following 
dependencies:  sakai-session, sakai-tool, sakai-sections-api, 
sakai-component and sakai-sections-comp-shared-sakai21
Maven doesn't complain while compiling since this object is instantied 
dynamically at runtime (although it probably should complain with 
approach 2??).

Is this a missing dependency at project.xml?
Anyone with the same problem who can help me with directions?

Thanks in advance,
Nuno Fernandes.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/126>","Hi Beth,

I did a little ""mad computer scientist"" experiment with Google language=20
tools.
It appears that it might be possible to do a quick (and obviously=20
faulty) machine translation of properties files into multiple languages.
Although it doesn't sound like much, that could change the task needed=20
for the native language speaker from completely translating them to=20
editorial review and checking.  In general, even if it consistently=20
mistranslates a word, a single search and replace will fix it, which=20
could save time.

For anybody not familiar with the properties format, they consist of=20
key-value pairs with lines  like:
assessment_create=3DCreate a new assessment
etc.

In general it appears that Google leaves the lvalues (left side of the=20
equals sign) alone, and attempts to translate the terms on the right.
If it is confused, it leaves terms alone, as long as there is a=20
character right after the equals sign.  It seems to be hesitant to=20
translate one word rvalue terms in such a setup, but I have found that=20
replacing =3D with ""=3Dx "" and then replacing it with ""=3D"" back again does=
=20
the trick.
For example:
cat=3Dx Cat  =20
dog=3Dx Dog  =20
rat=3Dx Rat   =20
pig=3Dx Pig
becomes
""cat=3Dxkatzedog=3Dxhunderat=3Dxrattepig=3Dxschwein"" --the only thing that =
is a=20
little ugly is it doesn't seem to preserve line breaks -- so you have to=20
manually fix them up.

It might be worth experimenting with further.
For example if you use these tricks
The following:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
assessments=3DAssessments
assessment_new=3DNew Assessment
assessment_create=3DCreate a new assessment
assessment_choose=3DChoose Existing Template
assessment_heading=3DSakai Assessment Manager
assessment_import=3DImport assessment
assessment_title=3DTitle
assessment_core=3DCore Assessments
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
translates to (im Googleusch)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
assessments=3DEinsch=E4tzungen
assessment_new=3Ddas neue Einsch=E4tzung
assessment_create=3Deine neue Einsch=E4tzung
assessment_choose=3Dverursachen, w=E4hlen vorhandene des Einsch=E4tzungsman=
agers
assessment_import=3Dder Schablone
assessment_heading=3DSakai der Importeinsch=E4tzung
assessment_title=3DKerneinsch=E4tzungen des Titels (OK, well,  so this one=
=20
looks a little like core + title.. no bots perfect....)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

To avoid insulting anybody, we should flag any such properties files=20
that we put in Subversion with ""# warning machine translation, editorial=20
process incomplete"" so that nobody tries to use a new translation in=20
production until reviewed by a native speaker.  After one, subtlety=20
keeps lost to all quantity in the machine translation.*

Or we could keep them to ourselves and check them in after=20
fluent-speaker review. ;)

--Ed



*After all a lot of subtlety gets lost in machine translation.

I have read all the messages regarding the SectionManager and I am 
conscious of the future API changes but this will save the work of 
entering hundreds of sections in sites and adding participants to the 
sections. I will be updating my code for reflecting such changes!
Thank you for the directions as they solved my problem and I do access 
the API now!

Thank you again,
Nuno.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/127>","Here are two late breaking news items for Sakai 2.1:

- Authorization Group Template Role Names
- New conversion needed for the 2.1 production branch (and trunk)


Authorization Group Template Role Names
----------------------------------------------------------

The new Site Group feature in Sakai 2.1 introduces new azg  
(Authorization Group, formally known as 'realm') templates:

- !group.template
- !group.template.course

In order for Site Groups to work properly, these templates must have  
the same roles defines as the cooresponding site azg templates:

- !site.template
- !site.template.course

or, they must have the superset of all the possible role names for  
course and project sites in your system.

Otherwise you will see the following:  add a user to a site group,  
and the user disappears from the group (with various errors in your  
server logs).  Users are given the same role in a site group as they  
have in the site, so the site group must have the same set of roles.   
The templates are used to create new site groups, so should have all  
the possible roles defined that you use in your system.

OOTB (out of the box), Sakai defines these roles for course sites:
- Student
- Instructor
- Teaching Assistant

(Note the case and the space - all is significant)

And for non-course (project) sites:
- access
- maintain

These are defined in the OOTB group templates as well.


New conversion needed for the production branch (and trunk)
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
-----------

If you are using the Sakai 2.1 production branch ( https:// 
source.sakaiproject.org/svn/branches/sakai_2-1/ ), as of svn r4692,  
there is a new database conversion needed for Tests & Quizzes (Samigo).

These are in the source:

sam/tool/src/sql/oracle/patches/SAK-2862.sql
sam/tool/src/sql/mysql/patches/SAK-2862.sql
sam/tool/src/sql/hsqldb/patches/SAK-2862.sql

For Oracle:

alter table SAM_ASSESSFEEDBACK_T
add (FEEDBACKAUTHORING integer);
alter table SAM_PUBLISHEDFEEDBACK_T
add (FEEDBACKAUTHORING integer);

INSERT INTO SAM_ASSESSMETADATA_T (""ASSESSMENTMETADATAID"",  
""ASSESSMENTID"",""LABEL"", ""ENTRY"")
VALUES(sam_assessMetaData_id_s.nextVal, 1,  
'feedbackAuthoring_isInstructorEditable', 'true');


For MySQL:

alter table SAM_ASSESSFEEDBACK_T
add column  FEEDBACKAUTHORING integer;
alter table SAM_PUBLISHEDFEEDBACK_T
add column  FEEDBACKAUTHORING integer;

INSERT INTO SAM_ASSESSMETADATA_T (ASSESSMENTMETADATAID, ASSESSMENTID,  
LABEL,
ENTRY)
VALUES(NULL, 1, 'feedbackAuthoring_isInstructorEditable', 'true');

Fix to SAK-111: WS: Add Participants Error Sometimes on Username(s).

Added a checkUserId() call in Validator to bypass the '@' invalid  
resource id char problem.
Change the addUser() in BaseUserDirectory to use checkUserId()  
instead of checkResourceId().
Minor fixes in WS to enhance the format of alert/log messages.

A question from maven luddite; I made some changes to providers and

maven sakai but it takes  15 minutes on my machine. What goal so that  
maven would only compile and deploy the
providers or src code that has changed.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/146>","Hi -- The requirements process was not ratified by the board, but was =20
rolled into the Sakai Community Practice (SCP) work. I do not expect =20
that it will have immediate impact on defining this upcoming release, =20
except in how the requirements that get placed there will serve to =20
inform the projects that are underway. For example, there are several =20
gradebook requirements there that the Grade book working group will =20
take into account as it plans its Spring deliverable. It would be =20
great if we were able to wrap of the SCP work so that the =20
requirements group could, as Chuck stated, get ahead.

There are only three requirements registered right now. The more that =20
are posted, the more likelihood that they will be useful toward =20
getting good sense of community priorities and resources.

I have no idea what is in the May 15 release. I only know that we are =20
planning on hosting our gradebook wg and will be continuing to expand =20
the feature set to fulfill the original requirements and others that =20
have risen to the top since 2.0.  No locking. Only open. However, =20
contributing institutions will have more influence.

I hope that the SCP will make this easier across the board.

All of these process will impact the 2.2 release.  Absolutely nothing =20
is set in stone for the release.  It all depends on what the =20
community decides to do.

As we move forward, we (Sakai Foundation) will begin to track =20
activity and resources across the community and report that back to =20
the community.  This is not to ""give orders"" to people and force them =20
to do things - but instead to make sure that we are all aware of what =20
is going on - hopefully with clear understanding (and advance notice) =20
of what is going on, it can trigger important discussions within the =20
community about things that are in progress.

The requirements DG needs to focus on informing the rest of the =20
community about requirements and if a strong case is made for =20
requirements, then hopefully resources will flow towards those =20
requirements in time to make a 2.2 release.   With a freeze date of =20
May 15, the Requirements DG will need to move pretty quickly to get =20
""ahead"" of the project development teams.

Hi Jon,

The error that u attached is a JSF error created when preparing teh dispaly
for a question but it shouldn't stopped Samigo nor Sakai functioning. This
error is not related to Glenn's news. I am not sure what it is that cause
the server to hang. Do you see any other errors after that? 

Glenn: any suggestions?

Lydia & Ed: we should probably find time to clean up those errors.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/151>","Hi All,

I am attempting to write a script that would create roster/user/ 
course information in Sakai from our custom data model.
Has anyone done this and could they share code snippets. I understand  
the data models are specific, but
my intention is to get familiarized with the API.

Any pointers to the API/tools source code would help as well. Any web  
services that Sakai exposes that I could use
for the above purpose?

Thanks a lot.

Regards,
Amit

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/147>","I've checked in a new, cool feature into subversion that allows users  
to dynamically change their language locale (without affecting other  
users). Kudos go to Tatsuki Sugiura for developing the ResourceLoader  
class that implements this. Details can be found at http:// 
collab.sakaiproject.org/access/content/group/1117804916661-111798/ 
sakai-dynamic-locales.doc.

All legacy tools have been converted to use the new ResourceLoader  
class, _but_ work still needs to be done to implement these changes  
in the following tools:

sakai/sample-tools/
sakai/gradebook
sakai/metaobj/
sakai/rwiki/
sakai/sam/
sakai/sections/
# sakai/tbd/  (any future tools should use the ResourceLoader too)

The changes are lightweight and easy to do -- I just don't feel I'm  
the best person to implement and test these, since I don't have prior  
experience using/modifying these tools. So I send this humble request  
to the hordes of Sakai developers out there who would be in a better  
position than me to make these changes. Please let me know if you  
have any questions -- I'd be happy to help.

If you want to see how it works, build the current version from the  
trunk, go to Preferences and change your language to ""Dutch"" (which  
is the most complete translation to date).

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/135>","Glenn mentioned SAK-2909 and -3099 in earlier postings. They are related with performance problems 
on Oracle. It appears to be a solution for Oracle *install* problems as well. We had problems with 
10g and 9i. But when we applied the fixes mentioned by Glenn we got it running. So, in addition to 
the install documentation you need to apply these two solutions.

Glenn, tell me if I'm wrong.

Victor Maijer

========================================================================
JIRA-snippet SAK-2909:

The way to set the default transaction isolation level is different. It is an override property now, 
rather than a placeholder property. Set it in sakai.properties like this:

defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED

* * *

For Oracle, we (CTools at University of Michigan) found it best for performance to leave the 
validation query and isolation level default unset. To get these values unset now, put this in you 
sakai.properties file:

# for best oracle performance
validationQuery@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=
testOnBorrow@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=false
defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=

=========================================================================
JIRA-snippet SAK-3099:

While bringing up Sakai Collab with the 2.1.0 software, we discovered a performance problem with the 
Oracle configuration. Database connection pooling is not working properly.

for 2.1.0 users, If you are using Oracle you can avoid this problem by editing the 
kernel/db-components components.xml file, and remove the following configuration:

<!-- The default read-only state of connections created by this pool. -->
<property name=""defaultReadOnly"">
<value>false</value>
</property>

By leaving the ""defaultReadOnly"" setting *unset*, the database pooling will again work properly.

If you are working from source, you can edit it before you build and deploy:

sakai/kernel/db-components/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml

If you are working with the binary, you can edit the deployed file from the components package 
(usually found in tomcat/components, but you may have placed them elsewhere). Do this while Sakai is 
*not* running:

tomcat/components/sakai-db-components/WEB-INF/components.xml

When you catch up with a Sakai version that has this fixed, your change to this file will no longer 
be necessary (but can be left in place).

plans or arriving at agreement on practices - need to be achieved in very
short order in order to have an impact for our schools in 2006.  There is a
fair degree of momentum behind 2.2 already, it's going to define Sakai in
2006 for us, and, what's more, will provide the ""first impression"" many of
our faculty will have, since we launch in the Fall.  I think that's the
ribbon-cutting period for a large number of other schools as well.  If
you'll excuse me, I need to go submit some requirements :)

I suspect that the wiki page you are trying to edit has the group 
permissions to update disabled on the page. A simple way to find this 
out is to look at the info tab for that page and check the 
Enable/Disabled row. If the Update and Admin columns have 'no' in them 
then unless your instructor role has rwiki.superadmin it won't be able 
to edit the page.

Now, if the instructor has the site.edit permission, just below the 
permissions block you should see:

""You may edit site permissions""

You could then give the instructor role ""rwiki.superadmin"" and they 
would never need to look at the permissions screen again.

A safer solution would be to login as a user that does have permission 
to update that page -- I suspect the owner will have permission, either 
that or use the sakai admin -- and change the page permissions to enable 
the instructor role to update the page.

Yuji:

I've attached the howto file I put together for myself and my fellow 
developers at the Yale Center for Language Study when we were having a hard 
time with 2.0. The file is geared toward getting everything going from 
scratch and so includes info on MySQL and getting the JDK.* While to some 
extent it falls into your out-dated category, I used it myself recently to 
set up a 2.1 dev environment on a laptop. (Sakai is not my primary task, so 
I have not memorized it yet.)

Tk

*I also tried to aim it at a pretty low level, so have mercy on parts that 
may seem insulting. :-)

In test and quizzes, one of our teachers have fill in the blanks=20

Our file system is AFS, with user quotas already established.  How does one
limit the file storage for users in Sakai given our scenario?  In the Sakai
Installation pages on collab, the sakai.properties parameters are defined

sakai.properties by providing volumes, such as:

""Files will be stored under each volume in a way so that there are not too
many in any one folder. The folder structure we use is:

YYYY/DDD/HH/id, where YYYY=year, DDD=day of year, HH=hour of day, and the

for example, 2005/070/03/3223479379834-2343""

My question(s) are: 

1.      How do we configure Sakai to utilize our existing file storage
setup?

2.      How do we limit Sakai users from adding large files (outside of the
global file upload size limitations in Sakai)?

3.      Is the format above determined by Environment variables, properties,
etc.?  Is it configurable?

My tools for adding a voiceover to my presentation keep failing me. I  
finally have a technique that works, but I have to wait for my 19 month  
old son to fall asleep before I can attempt to make a recording.

Thanks for your patience everyone. This is going to be good when it's  
finished.

cheers,

At UC Berkeley we run Oracle 9.2, and I naively thought that using the 
9.2 JDBC driver made good sense.  What we found was that this driver was 
unable to properly perform the auto-ddl table generation at startup, and 
was throwing errors when reading the realm tables.

Switching to the latest 10g driver solved these problems.  Thanks to 
Lance Speelmon for pointing this out.

If this is in fact missing from the install docs, I'd vote for adding it!

your Sakai server, and you must do tricks to make sure your AFS

Still struggling to find the time - I've got the raw footage at one  
of our servers at Roskilde - click the second image in the first row  
since the streaming one doesn't work:

http://130.226.196.228/SakaiWinter2005Conference.html

- these clips are pretty huge (100 mb) and with the audio a bit on  
the low level.

I'll see if I can get the into Confluence as direct links tomorrow   
(about 14 hours from now)...

Kind regards Gissur

Yeah XUL!  ;)
Including custom *.css in the plug-in or other desktop portion would be 
pretty cool.

As a short term fix, it's pretty easy to get rid of the top iframe with 
the toolbar.  I guess you loose the Reset and Help button, but those 
could probably be grafted on somewhere else desktopish.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/189>","Hi Shane,

Before I get too far, the OSS disclaimer:

The current status of Web Services for Sakai is pretty standard Open 
Source fare.  Things are taking a while to bake, and even longer for 
them to get documented. Getting involved at this point will definatley 
involve digging through code, as there's nothing remotely close to nice 
MSDNish documentation. This could actually be pretty valuable for a 
senior CS student, but probably not since there are more fun things to 
do during a senior year.

This isn't meant to be excuse, but an honest depiction of the current 
situation.  For the meantime you'll need to roll up your hacking sleeves 
and dig in.

On to the points:
1.  I fear that there is not much documentation except my 
O'Reilly-wannabe-freeflowing english, and maybe a few other tidbits 
laying around.  :)

I think Glenn is organizing a documentation project so perhaps something 
will come of that.

There are not a substantial amount of web services yet, and they are 
changing quickly.  It's a relatively new thing inside of Sakai. 
Personally I'm shooting for having it coelecse into a nice framework 
around Sakai 2.2.

2. These sorts of client-binding API's are definately the subject of 
daydreams. I've started to work on something like this for Python and 
JavaScript because that's what I want to use personally.  We *might* 
have good enough autogenerators eventually to automatically create these 
libraries for other languages, but most likey it will just show up from 
somebody who really wants Java Delegates.

As far as examples, some of this is actually my fault perse, as people 
do send me stuff on occasion and it takes me quite a while to get it 
into subversion, and even then it's not very organized. However, I 
haven't recieved any actual sample clients written in Java. ;)

Everything you point out is pretty important, it just takes a long time 
to get it done.

Discussion on the best way to proceed is always encouraged.  We have a 
web service list on collab too.

Generally the approach is to convert through each intermediate release
and be careful.

You should do 1.5.1 -> 2.0 and then 2.0 -> 2.1

You should make nice backups at each step and make sure to do a light
test with 2.0 during the middle step to make sure it all looks fine.

and be careful.

You should do 1.5.1 -> 2.0 and then 2.0 -> 2.1

You should make nice backups at each step and make sure to do a light
test with 2.0 during the middle step to make sure it all looks fine.

but the information is not nearly as prominent as it should be

""The version of the JDBC driver (or connector) is also important. For MySQL
the 3.1.10 connector should be used, while for Oracle the 10g driver should
be used...""

Burying that sort of information in the middle of the paragraph is just
begging for it to be missed, and I think there are other bits that also
deserve to be highlighted better (like all the things you may need to do to
upgrade an existing installation).  It's not enough to just squeeze the

I completely agree with your thoughts here.  Part of the goal of this  
little exploration is to end up with *Far better* UI approaches.   
Dragging and dropping is just one possibility :)

One feature I would love is for Resources to actually be expandable  
including folders, files, etc and then just drag and drop files back  
and forth.

Also this has the potential for making a REALLY accessible interface  
given that every single piece of the screen outside the browser part  
is completely under the programmer/designer's control.

I had network problems last two days and thought the Version 03  
message got stuck in my outbox late last night at 2AM - but it really  
got delivered without me knowing.

thinking the message never went out and with a fresh cup of Java this  
morning, I decided to add some features (see the nifty right click  
features on the tree view) and then re-send the message with a  
version 04 of the message and software.

So you saw two versions of the same message - one 8 hours later.  The  
best version of the code is the 04 - the one I just sent.

The software nicely deinstalls and reinstalls so if you used the 03  
edition - just uninstall 03 and reinstall 04.

Part of my goal here is to write code in a few languages and send it  
around to (a) make sure that we have cool web services rich enough to  
make this easy and (b) sample source code that folks can hack.  So  
now we have a nice implementation in Java (JSR-168 portlet) and VB to  
retrieve and display sites.  My next move (with enough time) is to  
take the Java code from the JSR-168 portlet and move it to a Cocoa  
Java application and release a Mac version so I can start using this  
as my way to see Sakai rather than a browser.  Maybe my Xmas present  
to myself will be 20 hours of uninterrupted coding time :)

Me too :)

Yes - this can be done.  It might be fun to do - I wanted to do this  
right by using XMLHttpRequest straight from VB - just like the  
browser - rather than hacking it in the iFrame.  It might be cool to  
have little numbers beside each site telling you how many people are  
in each place :)   Clicking on the numbers sends them a Sakai IM..

Turns out that Chat does not work well (you need to manually refresh)  
when it is ""alone"" and the Sakai Ajax background code is not  
happening.  This is a bug in Chat - I need to file a Jira.

Also, think of beginning to add value for things like a placement of  
a Sakai News Tool - we could add the actual RSS reference to the web  
service and then simply display it in a really cool RSS reader rather  
than an RSS reader running on a server in a frame.  Lots and lots of  
fun stuff.

The nice thing is that as each puzzle piece arrives, solving the rest  
of the puzzle becomes (a) more appealing and (b) easier :)

First the Title Bar.  This is a bit icky but can be done.  The tool  
bar will be *crazy* hard because it is not simply mimicking what  
Charon does.  So far, everything (including the title bar) is all  
nicely abstracted in Sakai to be Charon's responsiblity - So I can  
mimic Charon.   Getting below to the tool bar would require much more  
discipline on the part of developers of tools and it moves across an  
abstraction layer.

WSRP is not the ""express train"" - All of these experiments  
(especially the JSR-168 experiment) show the ""way"" that WSRP needs to  
evolve.  WSRP has a further problem in that it requires some  
discipline on the part of tool writers.   Since WSRP is not 100% done  
- we are not really fully ready to tell developers exactly what they  
should do.  So we need to get WSRP more mature and then work  
backwords to the tools.

Yes - Flash too.   And PHP.   And ASP.NET ....  These web services  
are stone simple to use.

Paul,

There is a preliminary tutorial here:

https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/trunk/sakai/docs/webservices/html/

Depending on which language you're using, you may need to know more or 
less about SOAP and actual Web Service Specifications.  If you're using 
a P-Language like Perl or Python (kinda PHP), you need very little 
prerequisite knowledge to get started.

collation does not match the charset/collation of your database.

use these to change the connection mode:

set NAMES utf8;
set CHARACTER SET utf8;

(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-connection.html)


Or change the default character set for your database:

ALTER DATABASE database_name DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE

This is a very simple script in perl to add sites rather than users, but 
changing the webservices methods invoked is the easier part:

I've just installed this, and also think it's exciting! I believe it's important 
to have a couple of alternate UIs around as reference implementations (and 
hopefully in production too) so that we keep a broad picture of all the possible 
uses for Sakai tools and content.

I'd like to see similar interfaces in XUL, Flash and for mobile devices.

I agree about the initial loss of 'place' (maybe because the presence indicator 
is missing) but can also think of even more exciting ways of integrating 
presence and user awareness to bring back place & presence - for example 
positioning chat tools as a tabbed section across the bottom with alert 
indicators for activity, event notification (new announcements, etc.).

These desktop clients could also be using a variety of connection technologies, 
e.g. web services, webdav, browser display, jabber/xmpp for pushing events & 
chat, etc.

The CANS project has created some widgets 
(http://myclass.missouri.edu/~amelungc/cans/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=2) 
- another piece of the puzzle. We don't yet have any integrated support for 
Jabber/XMPP in Sakai for pushing event notifications to clients in a scaleable 
way, but the possibilities are so appealing that I'm sure that problem won't be 
left unsolved for too long :-)

Cheers
Stephen

couple of things that may help you:
1- I've been able to post to servlets included in a webapp for a Sakai tool 
using just the root relative url for the servlet. E.g., if your tool's 
webapp is called 'mytool', then your root relative url would be 
'/mytool/myservlet...'. Of course, you would pass to your servlet whatever 
parameters you need.
2- Don't forget to filter your servlet with Sakai's RequestFilter, as 
explained in the Sakai documentation. Unless you do this, you will lose the 
Sakai session (including current user information).

I know, I know :-)  Too many ppl ask , and not enough offer...
Unfortunately, my company prevents me from working on any open source
project without ridiculous amounts of legal approval, so I'll have to remain
one of those lazy people who just try to make work for others :-(

Here is the trick at a high level.  Your applet needs to know the  
Sakai Session.   You can get the session in the tool that writes out  
the applet tag and pass it into the applet.

Write out the session is as one of the <applet> parameters.

Session s = SessionManager.getCurrentSession();
(check for null)
System.out.println(""Session = "" + s.getId()) ;

Then have the applet append the session to your servlet url as follows:

http://sakai.ust.hk/my-fun-servlet?sakai.session=FF1234565789899

The code that is now redirecting you (RequestFilter) will see this  
parameter and go right past the login processing and establish the  
servlet with the right identity.  This is useful for things that  
don't handle cookies.

Some applets share cookie space with their hosting browser and others  
do not.  Switching to the use of session based launch effectively  
guarantees that things will work regardless of applet vagaries.

Sakai session based launching (I think) was not in 2.0 or 2.0.1 but  
the patch is really small and easy to apply.  Look in the  
RequestFilter code.  But this is in 2.1 and the trunk.  If you want  
this to work with a 2.0.x based Sakai do a diff of

./kernel/request/src/java/org/sakaiproject/util/RequestFilter.java

Between the version you are using and the trunk in SVN.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/217>","Hi All

I'm trying to add functionality to the SPML module to support profile
information. Basically at this stage I want to populate a users profile
after the user object is created with UserDirectoryService.addUser().
Due to the way the SPML runs it is not tightly integrated with Sakai,
but runs similarly to other webservices.

So far I have tried various but the most successful (i.e. got the
furthest before I get a nullpointer exception) is:

ProfileManager prm = new ProfileManagerImpl();
SakaiPersonImpl thisUser = new SakaiPersonImpl();
thisUser.setUid(userid);
thisUser.setGivenName(firstname);
thisUser.setSurname(lastname);
thisUser.setMail(email);
//create the profile from the object
Profile profile = new ProfileImpl(thisUser);
prm.save(profile);

Where it all works till the last step.  Am I going about this the right
way, or is there a simpler better way of doing this? I'm trying to avoid
writing directly to the database.

Thanks in advance

David

That is totally cool.  Using and adopting is as much a contribution  
as writing code.

I fully understand the cost-benefit of trying to get permission to  
contribute directly.   Paperwork for this type of thing is either  
easy or impossible :)

Perhaps as you bust through the murky learning curve and into the  
clear blue skies of Sakai web services, you could post a note or two  
to the list and someone else could update a wiki or something so your  
effort will not be in vain - those who follow in your footsteps will  
be thankful.  :)

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/220>","Hi David,

I am adding user profile synchronization to a Quartz Job so I dealed 
with some of your problems. This is what I did in order to successfuly 
create/update the user profile:

1. You need to dynamicaly load ""SakaiPersonManager"" and 
""AgentGroupManager"" like the example below:
public SakaiPersonManager getSakaiPersonManager() {
if(sakaiPersonManager == null){
sakaiPersonManager = (SakaiPersonManager) 
ComponentManager.get(SakaiPersonManager.class.getName());
}
return sakaiPersonManager;
}
public AgentGroupManager getAgentGroupManager() {
if(agentGroupManager == null){
agentGroupManager = (AgentGroupManager) 
ComponentManager.get(AgentGroupManager.class.getName());
}
return agentGroupManager;
}


2. The profile corresponds to the sakai db table SAKAI_PERSON_T which 
have as primary keys agent_uuid and type_uuid. From what I have seen, 
this type used was always UserMutableType (even the admin user) - you 
will need to switch the session to the user you're modifying (method 
setSakaiSessionUser()). You can get existing/create new profile like this:
private SakaiPerson getUserProfile(String userId, String type) {
SakaiPersonManager spm = getSakaiPersonManager();
Agent agent = null;
try{
agent = 
getAgentGroupManager().getAgentBySessionManagerUserId(userId);
}catch(Exception e1){
LOG.error(""Failed to update profile for user "" + userId + "": 
"" + e1.getMessage());
return null;
}
setSakaiSessionUser(userId); // switch to that user's session
Type _type = spm.getUserMutableType();
SakaiPerson sakaiPerson = null;
if(agent != null){
try{
sakaiPerson = spm.getSakaiPerson(userId, _type);
// create profile if it doesn't exist
if(sakaiPerson == null){
sakaiPerson = spm.create(userId, userId, _type);
}
}catch(Exception e){
LOG.error(""Unknown error occurred in getUserProfile("" + 
userId + ""): "" + e.getMessage());
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
return sakaiPerson;
}
private synchronized void setSakaiSessionUser(String id) {
Session sakaiSession = SessionManager.getCurrentSession();
sakaiSession.setUserId(id);
sakaiSession.setUserEid(id);
}


3. After retrieving the SakaiPerson object, you can edit its properties 
and save to the database with the API. You can then switch back to the 
admin session:
private void updateUserProfile(String userId, String firstName, 
String lastName, String email, String dept, byte[] jpegPhoto, String type) {
if(userId == null || userId.equals("""")){
LOG.error(""Failed to update profile for user: (null or 
empty)."");
return;

Can I recommend that you make it available (somewhere) to the wider 
community?

Ideally, I'd like to see institutional examples for providers, Quartz 
jobs, sakai.properties files, etc.  made available for people to look 
over, etc. assuming that there aren't any institutional or legal 
obstacles. Checking out how other people have done things is often 
very useful before/during/after you try to tackle your own situation.

Perhaps a good place to collect these might be in the Enterprise 
group's Confluence area? That way questions/comments could be made.

I followed your indications in order to test the dynamic language

following errors:
- there is no drop-down language selector in preferences;
- when selecting Timezone I get the exception: ""Innapropriate object

Note: there is no pt resource bundle (yet).
Anyone having this kind of errors?

This is a great idea.  It is the Enterprise groups primary intent and  
purpose to facilitate this type of communication about how to  
install, configure, and maintain Sakai.

Also we do make SVNs in contrib if/when interest builds to the point  
where this nuggets need source control.

We have SVNs in contrib for Virginia, UNISA, etc already - these are  
most interesting to these sites, but it makes it really easy for  
other's to take a look at what is there, versions, etc.

Hi everybody.

Just in time for Christmas: After a comically difficult voiceover  
process* the Quicktime version of my conference presentation is  
available in Confluence.
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/download/attachments/9662/ 
developing_for_sakai.tar.gz

The title is ""Developing for Sakai: Getting Started"" and is the
first  
of what I hope will be a series of Sakai developer-to-developer  
training materials.

I welcome any feedback or requests for new topics.

ho ho ho,

* in case you're tempted to try it, I don't recommend recording a  
full-resolution screen movie with audio of a full-resolution screen  
movie running in Powerpoint.

I will checkout the most updated code! I couldn't find where to change

I will checkout with the new version.

Thank you Beth!

re-organized the Austin Conference confluence page into several large

were, so now you can page-search to find your favorite author!  Chuck 
mentioned that we should flag those entries that have presentation or

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/218>","Hi all

I have a Sakai tool which hosts an applet, and the applet in turn posts 
data to a servlet, which is packaged in the tool's war. This was working 
fine in Sakai 1.0 and 1.5, but now it wouldn't work in Sakai 2.0. The 
URL of my servlet now invokes Sakai's LoginTool servlet, which would 
complain of null user ID and password. Even when I added the 'eid' and 
'pw' parameters, as required by LoginTool, to the request in my applet, 
they'll still appear to be null when the request comes to LoginTool.

I wonder if I could somehow post to my servlet without the LoginTool 
being invoked? Any help would be appreciated.

cheers.
-Jon

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/239>","Hi,
I am currently trying to create batch jobs that create course sites by 
uploading the course information from our SIS into Sakai using the 
Scheduler tool. I am using Sakai 2.1.

I have been getting permission exceptions when the batch job runs. The 
logs display the following error message

Creating individual course sites
PermissionException -> org.sakaiproject.exception.PermissionException 
user=null lock=site.add resource=/site/2006,SPRING,BIS,001
Ending the Course Sync for Spring 2006

The error is thrown at the following line in the code

Site siteEdit = SiteService.addSite(bannerSiteId, ""course"");

I have created the site Id of the course as a comma-separated string of 
values.

I initially thought that the error was because of some abnormal locks. I 
cleared the locks on any sites by clearing the records from the 
SAKAI_LOCKS table, but that did not solve the issue.

Any suggestions on how to resolve the issue would be highly invaluable

Regards,
Vishwak

Don't be misled by the word ""lock"" in the log message - it should say  
""function""  It is lock because the code is ""unlocking"" something.

user=null is your real problem - you need to make sure the thread is  
running as admin.  Not being an expert in Quartz - I have no  
particular advice :)

As Chuck mentioned, you need a session going for the thread and log  
in a user.  Place something like this at the top of your jobs:

//  set the user information into the current session
Session sakaiSession = SessionManager.getCurrentSession();
sakaiSession.setUserId(""admin"");
sakaiSession.setUserEid(""admin"");

// establish the user's session
UsageSession session = UsageSessionService.startSession(""admin"",  
""127.0.0.1"", ""Quartz_Session"");

// update the user's externally provided realm definitions
AuthzGroupService.refreshUser(""admin"");

// post the login event
EventTrackingService.post(EventTrackingService.newEvent 
(UsageSessionService.EVENT_LOGIN, null, true));

There's a project underway called 'openwebfolder' (see 
http://openwebfolder.mozdev.org/) to add WebDAV capabilities to 
Firefox/Mozilla.

Looks like it would only work for Windows users since it ""just adds 
hooks so that Microsoft's WebDAV client can be invoked in a similar way 
like in IE.""

Other OSes, e.g., Mac OS X, would have to follow different instructions 
on setting up WebDAV, tho there is no particular reason why Apple Safari 
could not tie into WebDAV if you are on OS X 10.4 (Tiger). OS X 10.4 
supports WebDAV HTTPS (SSL), while earlier versions only supported HTTP.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/249>","If as admin you visit a My Worspace (or any worksite really), then go to 
the Resources tool there and click Revise Properties, there is a field 
which can be changed to specify the site quota, and override whatever 
default you have in place.

I don't know of any way to prevent a user from having a My Workspace. If 
they don't have one, it is created when they next login.

You can control what is in a particular type of user's my workspace 
using !user template sites. A user account has a type, and when that 
account first logs in, it gets a copy of the worksite associated with 
it's type. The associated worksite it gets is named like 
!user.<accounttype>. The account type is set when the account is created 
(the Type field on the account when creating a new user). If there is no 
!user.<accounttype> site to match the account type of a user, then they 
get a copy of the !user site for their my workspace.  So you can control 
what tools a particular type of user sees in their my workspace by 
editing the associated !user template worksite. Once their acount is 
created though, they have a my workspace of their own and changes to the 
!user template site wouldn't affect them.

I thought you might be able to create a !user.<accounttype> template 
site, then edit the site's resources tool and up the quota, and everyone 
with that account type would then get that new quota, but it didn't seem 
to work when I tried.

So, those more versed in sakaiscript can respond as to whether you can 
play with quotas that way.

override set in the template when their new my workspace is created. So 
to set the my workspace quota in my workspaces for a particular account

That's exactly what we're doing here at UCB.  I'll forward on a few 
tidbits we've gleaned by merging the app with our local codebase and 
asking IU lots of questions:

* Message Center's DB tables are not finalized yet.  Jarrod Lannan 
""would wait to execute the DDL until tomorrow (23rd) at the earliest.""

* Message Center uses its own permission setup, rather than relying on 
the framework's AuthzGroups.  It's pretty heavily integrated in the UI.

* It's unclear (to us, at least) how default permissions are set up.

* The code is still in flux, so proceed with caution.

With all of that said, the tool looks really sharp, and it's easy to 
deploy (it just dropped into our Sakai source and auto-ddl did its magic).

We're sending lots of positive vibes toward Indiana, and wishing them luck!

Which code base are you guys using in production?  The choices are to  
run the maintenance branch or release tag code.  It seems a bit  
easier to just use the maintenance branch code base to get frequent  
updates, but then they may not be QAed until a release tag is  
created. Any comments and or recommendations on this best practices  
issue?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/254>","The quota can be set at any level of collections by admin in  
Resources tool now. Is that necessary? I guess my question is whether  
the quota value should be set as an Resources tool attribute instead  
of attribute for multi-level collections.

It quota is a tool attribute, we could add the ""site root collection  
quota"" as a configuration variable into sakai.resources.xml file, so  
that it could be set from Admin Sites tool for ! 
user.template.ANY_TYPE, and used as default setting for new  
MyWorkspace site of ANY_TYPE users.

Correct me if I am wrong, but CAS only provides authentication correct?
This is compared to say LDAP where we adjust the UserDirectoryProvider
to give up email address and other information.

2.1.1. Just as importantly, IU has QA'ed post 2.1 code to their

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/257>","Hi,
I apologize if this question has already been answered,  and since I am 
really not very familiar with the Mercury site myself, this might seem 
trivial for some of you :-(.
I've noticed the following behavior: a 'maintain' user that has just been 
added logs in and has access to 2 sites : MyWorkspace and Mercury. The 
question is why does the mercury site come in, given that it doesn't for 
all the other users I've created? (admin has it, of course). A possible 
related point is that this user has logged in several times before given 
that there's LDAP access in this Sakai instance, and so he could log in 
without having an explicit user object in Sakai.
(when I configured my provider, I didn't set it to create new users in 
Sakai if they didn't already exist).
Is this the expected behavior?

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/263>","Hi everyone,

I'd like to call everyone's attention to the following JIRA item:

http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-3093

The changes to ""fix"" this issue have been checked into both the trunk 
and the 2.1/production/maintenance branch.

To summarize the report, in 2.1.0 and earlier versions with content 
stored on a file system, when a user tries to revise or delete a 
resource that has become ""unavailable"" to Sakai, Sakai refuses to 
delete the resource and displays an alert instead. Sakai makes no 
distinction between transient unavailability of the file system and a 
more permanent unavailability, for example if a file has been 
quarantined after a virus scan. A real-world use case has been 
reported by Indiana University.

The solution put in place is the following:

""We will revise Resources so a site maintainer can delete entries when 
the resource content body cannot be accessed in the server's file 
system. When that happens, it should be logged.

""This fix should allow deletion of a resource to proceed even in case 
of an error trying to access a resource body in the filesystem. The 
error will be logged with a warning that there may be an orphaned 
resource body.""

I came across this JIRA issue accidentally, so I thought people should 
be aware of this change as it may have local implications.

Seth

word I got from Lance was a Dec. 29 release, but as Chuck mentions, not a
part of a Sakai bundle in the near term.

If you want to play around with the code, you can find it in subversion:
https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/branches/forums-dev/

If you'd like to help test current functionality without worrying about the
code, it's on nightly2:
http://nightly2.sakaiproject.org/

It's now among the tools you can report Jira issues for.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/267>","What might be cool is for IU to tag messagecenter in SVN as it  
progresses over the next month or so.

Effectively this allows folks to use a known messagecenter version -  
or perhaps it is sufficient just to know the right ""r-number"" to use.

I agree on the wishing of IU good vibes :)

Now you need to do one more thing (it s always something).

The crude way of getting !user.* template changes to propagate is to 
delete all the individual my workspace sites in the db (usual warnings 
apply). SQL code for doing this was posted to sakai-dev a while ago (by 
Cheryl Woghan initially I think). This is the mysql version (the only 
copy we kept):

-- optional: drop all user myWorkspaces, so they get new ones (with new stuff)
delete from SAKAI_SITE_USER where site_id like '~%' and site_id != '~admin';
delete from SAKAI_SITE_TOOL_PROPERTY where site_id like '~%' and site_id != '~admin';
delete from SAKAI_SITE_TOOL where site_id like '~%' and site_id != '~admin';
delete from SAKAI_SITE_PAGE where site_id like '~%' and site_id != '~admin';
delete from SAKAI_SITE where site_id like '~%' and site_id != '~admin';

Users will then get new My Workspaces from the template when they login 
again.

Cheers
Stephen

Another option here would be to change the users' roles in My Workspace

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/278>","Hi everyone,

While modifying the stock Kerberos provider to do some caching (to 
alleviate any load that DAV logins might put on a KDC), I have been 
taking a closer look at the DAV servlet's behavior.

For 2.1, a change was made to force re-authentication for every DAV 
request. This wasn't being done before, but should have been for 
security reasons. A side effect of this change seems to be that the 
Sakai logs begin to fill with the following lines:

WARN: addSession: already have a session (2005-12-22 17:29:05,096 
http-9090-Processor25_org.sakaiproject.component.adaptor.UsageSessionServiceAdaptor)

after the user re-authenticates for DAV.

I think I have tracked this down to the login() call in:

legacy/util/src/java/org/sakaiproject/util/LoginUtil.java

which is called in:

legacy/dav/src/java/org/sakaiproject/dav/DavServlet.java

In this case, login() never checks for an existing session, but just 
tries to create a new one. This is producing the WARN message in the 
logs.

I did some poking around and came across assureSession() in:

kernel/request/src/java/org/sakaiproject/util/RequestFilter.java

where there is some checking done, etc. It's a ""protected"" thing so I 
am assuming it's local to the RequestFilter.

I am thinking that DavServlet needs to be using calling something like 
assureSession() instead of login(). Or perhaps login() could be made a 
bit smarter? Ideas anyone?

For completeness, this particular issue isn't specifically reported in 
JIRA, but one open item has the same error message with slightly 
different circumstances:

http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-2548

The best approach is to make a User Directory Provider if this

automatic.  Is this possible?

UCT will also be deploying 2.1.x (maintenance branch) for our 1 Feb 06 release, 
which will probably be before 2.1.1 is released.

There are enough changes since 2.1.0 to make the small additional risk of 
running a non-fully-QA'ed version worthwhile. In doing so, we're assuming 
(hoping?!) that the branch management of 2.1.x will be relatively conservative 
and not introduce any changes that could lead to significant instability.

Cheers
Stephen

It seems reasonable to me, though it would be nice to have a 
continuously-updated document (on Confluence perhaps) which summarises 
functionality changes in 2.1.x (rather than just bugfixes), in a more concise 
form than the JIRA entries themselves.

As the Sakai Community begins to find our collective way, I would =20
like to call your attention to what I hope you will find to be an =20
interesting and relevant dissertation from Martin Aspeli of the =20
London School of Economics:

http://dissertation.martinaspeli.net/

Plone has been brought up in the Sakai community before (such as =20
during the licensing discussions), and this study of the Plone =20
project touches on every aspect we think about on a daily basis with =20
Sakai. Aspeli hopes his paper will, ""not only assist researchers in =20
better understanding the interaction between the various aspects of a =20
mature open source project, but also help practitioners of open =20
source reflect upon their own processes.""

Here is the abstract:

""Many perspectives have been offered in the academic literature to =20
explain the phenomenon of open source software development. =20
Unfortunately, most studies fail to adequately account for the depth =20
and social complexity of the communities found at the heart of mature =20
open source projects. Through an in-depth interpretive case study of =20
Plone, a vibrant open source project, as well as an evaluation of the =20
existing literature on open source, a model of a mature open source =20
project is proposed. The model incorporates concepts such as the =20
project=92s life cycle, community-of-practice, culture, and business- =20
and end-user orientation. Limitations to this model are acknowledged, =20
and avenues for future research to improve theoretical accounts of =20
the social dynamics of open source communities are suggested.""

Best regards for the holiday,

Jim

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/283>","I have been playing with Charon's gallery mode in 2.1 and frankly I  
don't like it very well.    I mostly think that these problems are  
almost ""bugs"" just because we had not tested a lot of scenarios with  
gallery mode.  All of  my playing with Desktop presentation leads me  
to test gallery mode out a lot.

I am about to smack it around but wanted to get some input to make  
sure that I am doing the right thing and to make sure that no one has  
hacked around these problems and I don't want to break anyone's  
current use of gallery mode.

If you are using gallery (like Merced) in iFrame / Single Signon or  
using it with session based launching (like my JSR-168 portlet) there  
should be no changes - these two scenarios work fine already.

Others have talked about these problems here - I am reviewing them  
and then will go do something about them unless someone tells me  
otherwise.  I will put in JIRAs if we like all this so as to document  
the Who, What, Why of this.  I would like to put this into the  
maintenance branch as well so it makes 2.1.1.  Hence the ""wide""  
distribution of the question.

- Logout in gallery mode is broken - it sends you to full portal mode

- Logout in gallery mode is a dumb idea anyways - gallery lives in  
some other portal or display context and that is where logout should  
happen

Proposal: Kill logout in gallery mode.  If we really need it, make it  
optional and when we bring it back make it work so that when you  
logout and log back in you are *STILL* in gallery mode - I will jsut  
comment it out with a note rather than removing it.

- There seems to be no clean way to force login when coming into  
gallery mode - Since it is a variant of portal if you are anonymous  
you see the public gallery with no way of ""moving forward"" except to  
create  a new account - whoop-dee-doo.

Proposal A: Force login for gallery mode all the time

Proposal B: Make sure that we have a URL that can force login if we  
like.  I think that   /portal/login?url=/portal/gallery should do it  
- but it does not work.

I lean towards Proposal B because I like flexibility :)

No time to elaborate, but I agree with all this.  I had logged some jira
issues related to this already last week.

http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-3118
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-3119
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-3120

The issues are to the extent that I has abandoned gallery mode completely
for portal integration.

Again, I would like to help (after the holidays).

Subject: AFS vs NFS

We're in the process of using setting up a file server to store 
resources content for sakai for our app servers on RHEL 3.
It appears that majority of you are using AFS.
Is anyone using NFS? Also, is there a reason to use AFS over NFS?
We would prefer to err on the side of caution and use something that 
is tried and true.
Has anyone observed any issues with either one?
Any help will be much appreciated.
Kyong

I'm busy testing our providers here and noticed the following behaviour.
If you:

1) Create a course site with a roster that has no students in it yet.
2) add students to the roster (as would happen if a site was set-up
before the start of the year)

the cache of the authzgroup (realm) only seems to be updated if:
a) a user logs in  or
b) if you go to the admin realms tool and save the realm


This means that the roster tool can display some widely inaccurate
information about the course. Now have I made a mistake somewhere in my
provider or is this expected behaviour?

Sorry for not replying earlier.  Stanford has a mandatory 2-week shutdown
so most of us have been out of the office since Dec 19th.

Are there any exceptions thrown in the log when the blank screen happened?
Can you send us the log?  Also, can you send us the import xml file so we
can try to reproduce your problem locally?

thanks,
Lydia

Your Apache needs to be able to handle the HTTP requests for Tomcat  
so it can intercept and use mod_cas to protect the container login  
URL.  Have you heard of mod_jk?  You can use it as a connector module  
to turn Apache into a proxy for Tomcat.  Apache will answer all HTTP  
requests and make calls back to Tomcat when a Sakai URL needs to be  
handled.

Or you could try the servlet filter method described in the  
confluence doc and do your CAS check in tomcat instead of apache.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/288>","I'm trying to CASify Sakai 2.1, but for me a few thinks are not really 
clear at the moment.

I've done the steps in 
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/ENTR/CASifying+Sakai for 
CAS via an Apache module.

I have
- a CAS Server (which does nothing else than verfifying that a username 
matches a password),
- a Tomcat with Sakai 2.1 (Port 8080) and
- an Apache HTTPD Server (Port 80) with mod_cas

How does the Apache know about how to redirect to Tomcat? I have 
something like this in my httpd.conf:

LoadModule cas_module           modules/mod_cas.so

CASLoginURL http://somehost:8080/cas/login
CASHost somehost
CASValidate /cas/validate
CASLocalCacheInsecure On
CASAuthenticateOnly On
CASTrustedCerts /usr/local/apache2/verisignserverca.pem
CASDebug On

CASLocalCacheFile /home/www/cas_cache
CASLocalCacheSize 1000
CASLocalCacheTimeout 7200

<Location ""/cas-protected/"">
AuthType CAS
AuthName ""CAS""
require valid-user
</Location>

This is very close to what is described in confluence except that I used 
a location different from ""/sakai-login/container"". Apache and Tomcat 
aren't on the some hardware (but they can if they have to). If I try 
http://apache_host/cas-protected/ I'll get a redirect to my CAS server, 
can login and get a ticket. This is as expected. But how can I redirect 
from Apache via CAS to my Sakai?

My Tomcat's server.xml looks like (with tomcatAuthentication=""false""):

<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
<Connector port=""8009""
enableLookups=""false"" redirectPort=""8443""
tomcatAuthentication=""false"" URIEncoding=""UTF-8""
protocol=""AJP/1.3"" />

and I have

top.login = false
container.login = true

in sakai.properties.

I think there are some steps missing in confluence or is it just me?

Thanks for help!

Now I'm using CASfilter inside Tomcat. The ""damn"" https requirement 
forced me to set up an SSL-Tomcat for CAS. When clicking the login link 
it'll redirect me to my CAS server, but after submitting user 
credentials, I got this exception in catalina.out:

I added student enrollments to a site using the existing Web Services methods and then, a little later, deleted these student accounts through the Sakai GUI * as one would expect the students no longer showed up in the GUI as enrolled in the course.

But when I ran a customized Web Services method that returns the enrollments (using SiteService.getSite.getMembers as coded below) it returns the original enrollments even though I deleted these accounts in the GUI.  Is there a simple explanation for this or perhaps a doc that explains why this occurs?

Cheers,

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/297>","Hi all,

I was trying to setup our sakai installation to restrict the creation of 
course sites by the instructors - allowing only prohect sites. 
Apparently, the only solution was to edit the sakai.sitesetup.xml file 
like this:
<!-- <configuration name=""siteTypes"" value=""course,project"" /> -->
<configuration name=""siteTypes"" value=""project"" />
However, after this change, it is impossible to create any site in 
""Worksite Setup"" - nothing happens after clicking on ""New"". Is this a 
bug? Anyone with similar problems?

I also notice that an exception is periodicaly thrown to the logs about 
a (inexistent) missing ""chef_permissions-Main.vm"" file:
INFO: sakai.vm: Exception reading vm template: 
/vm/helper/chef_permissions-Main.vm 
org.apache.velocity.exception.ResourceNotFoundException: Unable to find 
resource '/vm/helper/chef_permissions-Main.vm' (2005-12-28 22:55:32,501 
TP-Processor10_org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].[/sakai-legacy-tools])

And this is because only a 
""/sakai-legacy-tools/vm/helper/chef_permissions.vm"" file exists. Is this 
a bug? Does anyone has a similar exception in the logs?

Thank you!
Greetings,
Nuno Fernandes.

what is the status of Twin Peaks for Sakai 2.1? I'd like to rewrite my 
html parser class (it's not srw, only simple html). How do I integrate 
my own local digital library in 2.1? I think I din't find a way to place 
my old classes...

The ""old"" way was to create a new folder and put MyLibQuery.java, 
MyLibResponse.java and MyLibResult.java into it and add some information 
to searchsource.xml.

Thanks
Jan

to folks east of Italy.

I have just finished an Apple/Cocoa Desktop similar to my  JSR-168   
and Visual Basic Desktop widgets.  It uses web services to log in (is  
possible) and retrieves sites and pages.

I attach the software (ZIP), Source code (tar) and a few screenshots.

The software supports both systems with and without web services.  If  
the system supports web services, the system retrieves sites and  
pages and displays them tree style.  If the Sakai Host does not  
support web services, they just act like glorified bookmarks.

The todo list includes deleting sites, renaming, them, actually  
storing things in properties between executions and storing  
credentials in KeyChain.

For now, It is fun :)

/Chuck

P.S. for the few I shared this with earlier - this is a new version  
01.zip file - it should actually work

running the script to upfate the db from 1.5.1 to 2.0. I am now stuck on
getting from 2.0 to 2.1.

I am trying to run the upgrade script located in the source files for
2.1. I am running MYSql 4.1 on a windows box. I am running the upgrade
script via the command line.

Here is where I am stuck:

This line is in the script from Sakai:

ALTER TABLE SAKAI_SITE_GROUP
ADD  ( FOREIGN KEY (SITE_ID) REFERENCES SAKAI_SITE );

It fails with this error:
ERROR 1005 (HY000) at line 32: Can't create table
'.\sakai\#sql-350_8.frm' (errno: 150)

Which, according to MYSql web site, 1005 (ER_CANT_CREATE_TABLE) 

Cannot create table. If the error message string refers to errno 150,
table creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not correctly
formed. 



Now If I use the GUI tool for MYSQL and manually try to make the change
that this line wants, the GUI tool produces this sql statement:

ALTER TABLE `sakai`.`sakai_site_group` ADD CONSTRAINT
`FK_sakai_site_group_1` FOREIGN KEY `FK_sakai_site_group_1` (`SITE_ID`)
REFERENCES `sakai_site` (`SITE_ID`)
ON DELETE RESTRICT
ON UPDATE RESTRICT;		

If I run this it works. I don't want to modify all the upgrade scripts,
shouldn't have to. What am I missing?

I'm guessing perhaps your client's connection character set and
collation does not match the charset/collation of your database.

use these to change the connection mode:

set NAMES utf8;
set CHARACTER SET utf8;

(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-connection.html)


Or change the default character set for your database:

ALTER DATABASE database_name DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE
utf8_general_ci;



(Make a backup first of course.)

Are you using the MySql version of the conversion script?  The syntax of
the ALTER TABLE statement looks an awful lot like the Oracle syntax.

within Message Center, so this message is intended to answer many of those
questions.

The default permissions for Message Center, that will be carried through to
the default settings template and every forum/topic for every site, should
be set within Realms for your university's specific site types and the
associated roles.  

In the near future, users will have the ability to change the permissions
per site, forum and/or topic, but at the present time we have locked down
the settings so that users may not change the default permissions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

No, there is no bug. We are running Melete with Sakai 2.1 with no issues. I
just tested the htmlarea version, just to be sure all is fine there, too, as
we don't use that version here, and John Leasia's helper.doc got uploaded
beautifully. See attached. It must be some (mis)configuration on your end. I
assume you have downloaded the Melete version for 2.1. Only one of my
developers is here at the moment, Murthy, and he is working around the clock
on various critical production issues - classes start next Monday. He will
not be able to get back to you right away, but he will. 

Thanks for your patience. 

Vivie

PS. Writing to sakai-dev, etudes-dev@foothill.edu, or melete@foothill.edu
works. Typically, you'll get a response from us on the same day.

I have come across this issue at some point and it turned out that I  
missed some of the required setup steps. Thins to look for:

- Make sure that /var/melete, /var/meleteDocs, and /var/uploads have  
r/w permissions for the sakai/tomcat user
- Make sure that you recursively copy the content of melete-2.1/var/ 
melete to /var/melete
- Make sure that you copied the meleteDocs.xml to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/ 
Catalina/localhost/

Also, how big was the file that you tried to upload?

strange (blocker!) situation where there is NO default template in any of
our course sites - new or existing - for the Instructor role (though all
perms are checked). Only Sakai admin has access to the default template. I
understand that there were improvements in the default template in 2.1
(flexibility in editing), so one should be there, right?

Have we overlooked something or is there a known issue? Any tips would be
greatly appreciated.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/311>","Hi,
I have lately been noticing some performance problems with Sakai 2.1 on 
my dev/test machine. When I click on any of the tools there is a 30 -  
40 seconds delay before the page is rendered.

The performance is especially bad on the Section Info tool. Many of our 
courses contain 14 - 20 sections. The Section Info takes more than a 
minute to render the page that contains the Section information for 
these 14-20 sections.

My dev/test machine is  a Fedora  Linux Desktop with 1 GB of memory and 
has only one instance of the Tomcat running. I am using apache tomcat 
5.5.12.
My JAVA_OPTS setting is ""-Xms256m -Xmx512m"".

I did a top on my system and did not notice any significant CPU usage 
due to Sakai.  The values for %CPU was 0.7 and %MEM was 43.5.

Has anybody else noticed similar problems with Sakai 2.1 ?

I would be happy to give more details , if required about the hardware 
configurations and software being used.

Regards,

Hi Vivie,

The default template was removed by design for Sakai 2.1.  We figured that 
since all settings should be viewable/editable by default from now on,  it 
would simplify things for instructors if the default template was 
transparent.   An instructor should only need to deal with templates if she 
or he wants to limit the available settings in created assessments.

Does that make sense? There shouldn't be any loss of functionality at all 
(if there is for you, please let us know!);  the intent of this change just 
to make the user experience less confusing.  Hopefully it won't have the 
opposite effect. :)

Thanks,
Margaret

Peter Knoop and John Leasia shed light into the issue earlier today -
explaining the new behavior and directing me to a Jira issue that mentions
the change in the default template in Samigo 2.1.
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-2792.

This is a GREAT change, but it is a major shift, and I just wish the
information was included in the release notes. It would have saved us many
hours of troubleshooting and undue stress. You see, we moved from Samigo
2.0.0 (in our pilot production) all the way to 2.1 and it was hard to know
if it was something we did to lose the all-powerful default template of the
past from our production environment. 

Thank you and your teammates for the change; it will eliminate most of the
faculty support issues with Samigo. 

Best,
Vivie

...Ow.  I'm so sorry this caused trouble for you; clearly we should have 
put it in the release notes, and we'll try to document such changes better 
in future.

Hi Magnus,

It sounds as though you may be seeing the same bug we are 
here:  SAK-3005.  We're working on it and will let you know when we have a 
fix.  (If the description in the comments doesn't match what you are 
seeing, can you send me more details?)

Thanks,
Margaret

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/317>","Stupid question... don't beat me, I can't see the wood for the trees... ;)

I have a project below 
osid/api-impl/src/java/org/sakaiproject/component/osid/repository/

and want to use DomUtils and StringUtils from org.sakaiproject.tool.util.

I added a dependency for sakai-osid-repo-test in osid/api-impl/project.xml:

<dependency>
<groupId>sakaiproject</groupId>
<artifactId>sakai-osid-repo-test</artifactId>
<version>${sakai.version}</version>
</dependency>

but sakai-osid-repo-test-* only exists as war, so maven attempts to 
download some sakai-osid-repo-test-*.jar, which doesn't exist.

Without the dependency maven failed while compiling sources with 
org.sakaiproject.tool.util.*

Any ideas?

Thanks
Jan

PS: sorry for that dumb question, but it's a bit too late for me to see 
the right answer... :)

We had windows clients hanging in the same configuration as yours; I'm not
sure if it's a proxy in the middle or Apache, but here goes what we found out:

the doPropfind method opens an input stream with 0 bytes to read and blocks:


legacy/dav/src/java/org/sakaiproject/dav/DavServlet.java

after:

DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = getDocumentBuilder();

// Parse the input XML to see what they really want
try {
InputStream is = req.getInputStream();

add:
if(is.available() == 0) throw new Exception(""Exception:
Zero bytes"");

you have probably to import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException; 

I hope it helps;

Without Apache this didn't happen.

Best guess I can make is that the certificate the CAS provider is 
producing isn't one that JVM trusts. Looks like you'll need to register 
the certificate into the JVM, using keytool etc. (Don't ask me how! I 
only remember this because of trouble I had with another certificate - 
in the end I registered the bouncycastle provider 'coz it gave me more 
configurable power.)

The thing to google is probably:

sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/332>","This is something that's not really explained in the presentation:
The maven goals used by Sakai are only available if the maven sakai  
plugin is available. The plugin is available in two ways:
1) if you run maven against a project.xml file that has the sakai  
plugin as a dependency. See the project.xml file in the top-level  
Sakai source directory for an example of this.
2) if you install the Sakai plugin permanently into your maven  
installation. This is performed with the command maven  
plugin:download -DartifactId=sakai -DgroupId=sakaiproject - 
Dversion=2.1 -Dmaven.repo.remote=http://cvs.sakaiproject.org/maven/

In practical terms, this means that if you run maven in the same  
directory as the top level of the Sakai source code, you won't get  
the 'Goal ""sakai:build"" does not exist in this project.' error. On  
the other hand, if you just install the Sakai plugin for maven, you  
can run maven in any directory and it will know about all the maven  
sakai goals.

For your reference, here is a list of all the goals in the Sakai  
plugin for maven:
sakai ............................................ clean then build  
then deploy
sakai:build  ................................. compile and package  
the build
sakai:clean ................................. cleanup from prior builds
sakai:clean_build  ..................... clean and then build
sakai:clean_build_deploy  ...... clean then build then deploy
sakai:deploy  ............................. deploy to the local tomcat
sakai:deploy-report  ................. Report on what jars Sakai  
deploys - which
projects  
deploy what to where
sakai:deploy-zip  ...................... deploy to the  
maven.deploy.home and zip a
tomcat  
overlay structure
sakai:undeploy  ....................... remove from the local tomcat

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/322>","Hi Steven

I had a look around, and there is a pretty solid Java Web Service client
generator available from the Apache Axis project, at
http://ws.apache.org/axis . It contains a command line tool which passes a
WSDL file to a class called WSDL2Java, which then generates all the
necessary code.  The Javadoc for that class is here -
http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/wsdl/WSDL2Java.html.
I've tried out the latest stable version,
1.3, and it works very well.

The user guide for the WSDL2Java tool is at
http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html#WSDL2JavaBuildingStubsSkeletonsAndDataTypesFromWSDL

It also contains an Ant task to integrate the class building with an Ant
based build process.

So, an hour or so's work and it should be possible to generate client code
for all WSDL files in Sakai!

Hope this helps,

Shane

I have a couple of questions re: storing course content in the file system:



1.  Where is the inherent path detailed in code (e.g. ContentHostingService,
etc.)?  I am not talking about the ${sakai.home}/content override path, but
the actual YYYY/DDD/HH/id path given below. 



2. Is there a way to override Sakai's inherent pathing?  The below example
is taken from the Confluence page on configuration:



"" Files will be stored under each volume in a way so that there are not too
many in any one folder. The folder structure Sakai uses is:

YYYY/DDD/HH/id, where YYYY=year, DDD=day of year, HH=hour of day, and the
1111...=an id-based file name



for example,



2005/070/03/3223479379834-2343



or, using the above root and volumes, it might be:



/usr/local/sakai/content/v2/2005/070/03/3223479379834-2343""





The reason for this override is to utilize our current AFS configuration if
possible. 





Thanks in advance,

The production branch is a stable as you find it to be.  Various  
folks are using code from the production branch in production (thus  
the name).  Indiana is one.  The purpose of the production branch is  
to have code that is bug-fix better than the 2.1.0 release.

looks to be implementing a Hands Off security model. The content must 
remain immune to end-user tinkering.

In our current offering we do this by close setting of the AFS ACLs. 
Members of a course have access to the course AFS space
with the exception of the contained CourseWork managed 'subdirectories.'

The real win for us is in per-course (dept, etc) Quota Management. 
ka-CHING$$$!!

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/339>","The code that forms the path is in the content hosting service  
implementation, either the base or the db version.  If you need to  
change it, you should be able to extend the class and replace the  
pathing code with your own version, then register the new code as the  
content hosting service implementation.

But... don't think that you can change it so that you can ""tie in"" to  
an existing set of AFS space that the user already has.  This will  
not work.  Sakai needs a private file system to store the body bytes  
of the files in content hosting - this is really a mixed store, with  
the meta data in the database and the bytes in files in the file  
system.  This private file system must be private to Sakai; the Sakai  
servers must have credentials to work in there, and no other process  
should be creating or deleting files from this private file system.

Specifically, if you have end-user AFS space, this cannot be tied  
into in Sakai with the content hosting service we currently have.   
Not to say that it can't be written... problems include proxying the  
end-user's credentials through the Sakai server to access the data,  
and synchronizing the meta data in the Sakai database with changes   
made by other applications to the file area.

As we are expanding our services at UC Berkeley, we have found that 
adding application servers to our load balanced setup has greatly 
increased the number of opened connection pools to our Oracle DB. From 
our research, we find that each instance of Sakai opens 32 connections 
to Oracle by default (no setting changes) and even if you lower the 
minIdle/maxIdle configurations in sakai.properties, you still get 32 
connections once someone connects to it initially.

If someone can confirm these findings, that would be great. And if 
anyone has any ideas on how to reduce the number of connections without 
affecting Sakai, that would be very helpful as well.

Thanks,

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/340>","I am considering building an online course to deliver SCUBA instruction and am investigating Sakai as a platform for doing so. Before I proceed, I was hoping to get some feedback on whether Sakai is a good fit for the application.

Here are some of our requirements:

1) Deliver multi-media content in the form of Java Applets & QuickTime clips.

2) Create an ""audit trail"" of time spent on each section and quiz question answers.

3) Create a pool of questions that all test the same concept. This is required since we require 100% Correct answers prior to moving on to the next section of the course. We will continue to test the student until they achieve 100%.

4) Ideally, would like to deliver the same course with unique branding elements depending on the url the course was initially accessed from. In other words, include the logo for a marketing partner that is using the platform to train students.

5) Dynamically register students after they have paid for the class. Currently, we automatically send the student an email with a unique access code (dynamically pulled from a table of pre-made access codes) right after they complete the purchase of the class.

6) Allow the student to come back and ""review"" the course material after ""graduation"" whenever they feel like it.

Other than these requirements, I think that our needs are pretty basic.

If you have a moment to respond to this post, I'd really appreciate it.

I'm facing the same problem and even tried to accomplish that by editing 
the file ""legacy/tools/src/webapp/tools/sakai.sitesetup.xml"" like this:
<!-- <configuration name=""siteTypes"" value=""course,project"" /> -->
<configuration name=""siteTypes"" value=""project"" />

But, unfortunely, after this change I was unable create sites in the 
""Worksite Setup""/New (only in ""Sites""/New)....
Still searching for a solution...

from SVN ( svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/tags_2-1-0 ),
which still has the same problem: I can't use the at symbol (@) in
usernames. When attempting to create a user (through the admin
workspace) I still get the error message ""Alert: The user id is
invalid"".
Perhaps this is due to some misunderstanding on my part about where I
should download the source from.
Is the 'tags' release different to the maintenance branch? If so, where
is the maintenance branch? is it as stable for production use as tags?

Many Thanks,

Paul

System, Chuck.  A good LMS allows a student to register, view content, 
sequence material based on assessments, track progress, etc.

Sakai isn't really designed to do that at this time, though it is an 
interesting avenue for exploration.  Sakai is intended to support 
classroom learning and foster on-line collaboration for both learning 
and projects.

Below is my informal assessment of what Sakai can and can't do for you
with respect to your needs.  Some of the features you are looking for
are found in major vendor LMSs.  Many in the Sakai community would like
to see these features incorporated into Sakai as well and given the
momentum it won't be very long before we get there.  

Luke

>>> Chuck Whiteman <cwhiteman@holidaydiver.com> 01/04/06 1:52 PM >>>
I am considering building an online course to deliver SCUBA instruction
and am investigating Sakai as a platform for doing so. Before I proceed,
I was hoping to get some feedback on whether Sakai is a good fit for the
application.

Here are some of our requirements:

1) Deliver multi-media content in the form of Java Applets & QuickTime
clips.

Sakai can host this content and make it easily accessible within a
course.  You can choose to author the content in whatever your favorite
html/multimedia editors are and then upload them to Sakai. 
Alternatively you could integrate an authoring tool like Melete or LAMS
into Sakai to help out with the authoring within Sakai proper.

2) Create an ""audit trail"" of time spent on each section and quiz
question answers.

I'm not aware of these utilities existing in Sakai yet although I'd
expect that they have been entered as requirements.  They certainly
exist in products like WebCT and I'd hazard that a significant portion
of the Sakai community would like to see them in Sakai as well.  I'm
delivering my first course in Sakai this semester and will miss
comprehensive audit trails as they existed in my WebCT course (that's
not to say that there aren't other wonderful things in Sakai that make
up for this deficit).


3) Create a pool of questions that all test the same concept. This is
required since we require 100% Correct answers prior to moving on to the
next section of the course. We will continue to test the student until
they achieve 100%.

Sakai has a Quizzing tool that will allow you to author and deliver
question banks.  It doesn't at this time allow you to perform what the
major LMS vendor refers to as ""Selective Release"" (although again, I'd
expect that Sakai will eventually have this as well).  Selective release
is another feature I will miss just a little bit in my Sakai course.

4) Ideally, would like to deliver the same course with unique branding
elements depending on the url the course was initially accessed from. In
other words, include the logo for a marketing partner that is using the
platform to train students.

I'm not sure about this.....there are skinning features in Sakai that
may allow you to accomplish these things.

5) Dynamically register students after they have paid for the class.
Currently, we automatically send the student an email with a unique
access code (dynamically pulled from a table of pre-made access codes)
right after they complete the purchase of the class.

Out of the box Sakai doesn't do this nor for that matter does a
commercial LMS vendor like WebCT.  However, both can do this if you
integrate them with a registration system.  

6) Allow the student to come back and ""review"" the course material after
""graduation"" whenever they feel like it.

Sakai can do this. 

Other than these requirements, I think that our needs are pretty basic.

If you have a moment to respond to this post, I'd really appreciate it.

following the ongoing dev
discussions here with an eye to integrating sakai with SCT Luminis / 
banner as a replacement for
webct.  I'm assuming that I'll be able to sell Edison on the project, at 
which point I've already
been planning on taking a stab at this myself.  If anyone else is 
already working on this, or can
provide insight into possible related projects (Uportal integration 
springs to mind), I'd be delighted
to see what material is available.

That's not entirely on topic with your question, Carlos, but I'm 
thinking we may be going down somewhat
similar paths here.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/349>","To use ldap/Novell password authentication you may first had to contact the
ldap admin person on campus to allow sakai server access. Then you just need
to alter a couple of files before rebuilding.

NB - Changes detailed here are from my own documentation, so things may be
very specific to my situation and different for
yours. I understand that you can connect to a test server at nldap.com
[Novell default] but I could never connect to it - possibly firewall[?]).


Alter $SAKAI-SRC\providers\component\src\webapp\WEB-INF\components.xml:
Comment out:
<bean id=""org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.user.UserDirectoryProvider""
class=""org.sakaiproject.component.legacy.user.SampleUserDirectoryProvider""
init-method=""init""
destroy-method=""destroy""
singleton=""true"">
</bean>
and un-comment part starting with:
<bean id=""org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.user.UserDirectoryProvider""
class=""edu.amc.sakai.user.JLDAPDirectoryProvider""
init-method=""init""
destroy-method=""destroy""
singleton=""true"">
Replace:
<!-- property name=""ldapHost""><value>nldap.com</value></property -->
with
<property
name=""ldapHost""><value>ldap-server.your-university.ac.uk</value></property>
[NB: for dns problems try the IP address instead of
ldap-server.your-university.ac.uk]

And replace
<!--property
name=""basePath""><value>ou=sakai-ldap,ou=user,o=novell</value></property-->
With (this bit is probably very specific to my establishment)
<property name=""basePath""><value>ou=People, dc=ldapauth</value></property>

And replace
<!--entry key=""login""><value>cn</value></entry-->   
With (this bit is also probably very specific to my establishment)
<entry key=""login""><value>uid</value></entry>


Amend: $sakai-src\providers\component\project.xml:
Un-comment:
<!-- Needed for the JLDAP Provider
<dependency>
<groupId>sakaiproject</groupId>
<artifactId>sakai-jldap-provider</artifactId>
<version>${pom.currentVersion}</version>
<properties>
<war.bundle>true</war.bundle>
</properties>
</dependency>
-->

Then rebuild sakai and create a user with an existing ldap username, but no
password, and you should be able to login via ldap.

Hope this helps.

Hi

We are having Sakai 2.1.0 version running very fine
with Oracle server. 

We have to include LDAP for this SAKAI, means we are
having Active Directory Server we have to authenticate
with this server.
Can you tell me the procedure how to setup LDAP.

Thanks & Regards,
lateef

4. Update Sakai Roles (under realms) to include JForum permissions

4.1 Check appropriate Melete permissions under the roles in
!site.template.course.

* Check melete.author for teacher, instructor, faculty
types of roles (maintain).
* Check melete.student for student types of custom roles
that you have (access).

4.2. If you have project sites and related roles in
!site.template.project, appropriate
permissions (jforum.manage or jforum.member) need to be
checked as defined above.

CAUTION:

a. IF YOU FAIL TO CHECK THE MELETE.STUDENT AND
MELETE.AUTHOR PERMISSIONS FOR YOUR
ROLES, MELETE WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY.
b. IF YOU ADD MELETE TO _EXISTING SITES_, USERS WILL NOT
HAVE THE MELETE PERMISSIONS
THAT YOU CHECKED. YOU WILL NEED TO USE
!SITE.HELPER OR OTHER SCRIPT TO PROPAGAGE
THE CHANGES.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/351>","The 4.2.b below mentions the site helper or a script - it's not really a 
site helper script.  Site helper refers to the !site.helper realm, which 
can be used to transmit permissions to existing site realms. So if the 
problem is that Melete isn't working in sites you created before you 
added Melete to the mix, then !site.helper may work. You need to update 
any pre-existing site's realm to add Melete  permissions since adding 
them to !site.template.course only affects sites created after the 
change to !site.template.course.
There a doc  about site.helper in the Sakai Dev Resources -
http://collab.sakaiproject.org/access/content/group/1097928811887-22636/Architecture%20Docs/Sakai%202/helper_realm.pdf

If you have made appropriate changes to !site.template.course and then 
create a new course site, and Melete isn't working, then something else 
is going on and maybe the Melete folks can figure it out.

I would recommed starting by exploring the sample JSF tools in the 
module ""sample-tools/"" in the sakai source dir. You can try this samples 
by adding the tools to a site (using ""Site"" and not ""WorkSite Setup"").
I am too doing my first researches on tool development so can't help you 
much further for now...

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/352>","I have been doing some research into building my own Sakai tools. So far
I have been able to build a simple tool using a basic HttpServlet based
class.

While this works great for simple things, I want to use JSF for the more
complex stuff.



I have made a second tool that does exactly the same as my first tool,
but makes use of JSF.

There's a problem with this tool, it gives me an errormessage:



ERROR: Servlet.service() for servlet jsp threw exception (2006-01-05
18:25:02,151 http-8080
Processor23_org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost
].[/sakai-helloworld-tool].[jsp])

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: The absolute uri:
http://sakaiproject.org/jsf/sakai cannot be resolved in either web.xml
or the jar files deployed with this application at
org.apache.jasper.compiler.DefaultErrorHandler.jspError(DefaultErrorHand
ler.java:50)



This is weird, because none of the samples I have seen need to have the
custom tag to be configured in the web.xml

Anyone can enlighten me why the custom tags don't work?

This line takes care of including the sakai UI tags, but appearantly its

Onderwerp: Re: Building a JSF Tool

Hi Willem,
I would recommed starting by exploring the sample JSF tools in the 
module ""sample-tools/"" in the sakai source dir. You can try this samples

by adding the tools to a site (using ""Site"" and not ""WorkSite Setup"").
I am too doing my first researches on tool development so can't help you

much further for now...

I took a few minutes and modified the BasicNewsService to use the ROME
syndication api... the news tool seems to accept more rss urls and now
ATOM as well, but I've only done limited testing. You'll need to
manually add rome-0.7.jar to your maven repo.

Chuck, I haven't looked at the license for ROME in detail but here's the
site:

This usually is a small configuration error or a bad database  
connection.

The quick suggestion is to go back through the install process  
carefully.

One thing I always check is to make sure my ~/build.properties has a  
trailing slash for the maven.tomcat.home

maven.repo.remote = http://cvs.sakaiproject.org/maven,http:// 
www.ibiblio.org/maven
maven.tomcat.home = /Users/csev/dev/jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/

But this one sounds more like a bad database connection.

Hi Nuno,



I seem to get this if I try to do the setJpegPhoto call in a script. I

don't seem to get it if I don't try to set the users photo. If I don't

make this call I don't see the error.  Also that call doesn't seem to

work to set the photo (though that could be an error in my script) - is

SakaiPerson.setJpegPhoto() the way one should be getting institutional

photos into Sakia?



Regards



David

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/365>","Hi Aaron,

We had the same permissions problem because melete was added after the 
sites creation. As John Leasia said, you can workaround using the 
sakai.help or you can use a script to update the sakai db.

Using sakai.helper you are creating rule exceptions because you are not 
adding the permission to each user realm but, overlapping each user 
realm with the specified in sakai.helper. We opted to do it using a 
script, updating directly each user realm.
I have attached such script (in perl) wich you can customize for your 
needs. I have also commented the script for better understanding. If you 
use it, please let me know if you need further help!

Hope it helps.
Nuno Fernandes.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/370>","For those of you using the production maintenance branch, I highly
recommend you change your procedures.  Two things are occurring that
will warrant this change:



1.	We are about to potentially destabilize /branches/sakai_2-1/
(the current production maintenance branch) in order to prepare for the
future Sakai 2.1.2 release which will include many commits from HEAD
that are currently missing from the branch.  This statement will of
course naturally lead you to the next point...
2.	The preparations for the Sakai 2.1.1 release are beginning to
get underway.  To support this effort I have copied the current
production maintenance branch to /branches/sakai_2-1-1/ as of r5139.
For those of you running production releases off of the maintenance
branch, you should switch your builds to this new branch immediately.
Moving forward, only fixes that are deemed ""worthy"" for the 2.1.1
release will be merged into this branch so it will remain quite stable
and receive relatively few deltas.  In a few days, we will be creating
the first sakai_2-1-1_001 tag from this new branch.



Cheers, L



PS - IU will be running /branches/sakai_2-1-1@5139 this coming Thursday
12 January 2006.

As stated below I don't know of a  way to selectively set quotas on 
sites of a particular type other than by running some script.

The different tool lists for different types of accounts can be 
accomplished by creating site templates for each type of user. 
!site.template.Undergrad_student, !site.template.Postgrad_student, etc.  
Edit each of those sites and put in whatever pages/tools you want, and 
then when a new account logs in, they get a My Workspace according to 
the associated template.  This would affect only accounts which logged 
in for the first time after you established those templates.

There is  no step by step manual at this point. See the ppt presentation 
made at the Austin conference at
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9638
for an overview which includes a bit of information about site.templates.

Many have used scripts to do similar things to existing sites using 
scripts. Maybe someone can supply one and you could set that up as a 
quartz job I suppose.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/375>","This procedure seems a bit strange to me as well, but I am sure that  
there is a good reason for doing this.

I am wondering why Sakai is using a little different approach of  
managing trunk, branches, and tags?  The following is a widely  
practice process:

In trunk happens all the development. There are usually a few  
scenarios when branches are created from trunk:
1. Trying something new/experimental

2. Trunk is ""NEARING"" a project release quality
-- Trunk is tagged along with alpha, beta, RC1, ..
-- There are cases where one creates a Release/Maintenance branch  
rather earlier then later depending on the development environment so  
it may happen that one creates a maintenance branch at beta or RC  
stage so that rapid development can continue in trunk.
-- At that point a Release/Maintenance branch is created, e.g. Sakai  
v2.1.z . Then this branch is brought up to release quality, which may  
see some tagging e.g. v2.1.0-RC2, etc. Once that branch reaches  
release quality, an official release tag  e.g. Sakai v2.1.0 is created

3. Trunk is ""AT"" project release quality
-- Trunk has been tagged with alpha, beta, RC1, ..., tags and reaches  
release quality
-- At that point a Release/Maintenance branch is created, e.g. Sakai  
v2.1.z . At the same time, an official release tag is created of the  
maintenance branch e.g. Sakai v2.1.0

Once a release/maintenance branch is created, ONLY bug fixes will be  
applied. This allows folks to run release tags of the maintenance  
branch and not actually the maintenance branch code, which may  
contain bug-fixes that ore not quite tested yet.

So the above process description may look like this:

e.g. Sakai v2.1.0 release

1. trunk: development and tagging with v2.1.0-a1, ...,  v2.1.0- 
b1, ..., v2.1.0-RC1, ... (Lots of Q/A)
2. trunk is reaching v2.1.0 release quality: create maintenance  
branch v2.1.z
3. create official release tag v2.1.0 off maintenance branch v2.1.z
4. continue development in trunk towards v2.2.0 or whatever version  
number is appropriate (See note below)
5. apply bug-fixes to v2.1.z maintenance branch and create tag  
releases if Q/Aed v2.1.1, v2.1.2 etc. (During the Q/A process it may  
be appropriate to create test tags of the maintenance branch so we  
may have v2.1.1-RC1, etc. before release tag v2.1.1 is created.


NOTE:

We have discussed this earlier at the UofM boot camp, but it would  
make sense to go a step further  in the way we manage our release  
numbers.  In my opinion, it would make a lot of sense to adopt a  
Linux style version numbering schema where odd and even numbers are  
used to differentiate between development and production code.

Development:
v1.1.z
v1.2.z
...
v2.1.z
v2.3.z
etc.

Production:
v1.0.z
v1.2.z
...
v2.0.z
v2.2.z
etc.

I can tell you that we will likely have a M2 release ready by the end of
next week (13 January 2006) which will add group capabilities.  We are also
working on a document that outlines via a timeline when additional
capabilities will be added.  When this document is ready, I will share it
with the community.

Well, getting ready for the 2.1.1 release should all happen in the  
already existing v2.1.z branch, there is no need for a new branch.

So folks who need maintenance branch bug fixes earlier could either  
dangerously deploy off the maintenance branch or apply specific SVN  
revisions that correlate to JIRA issues.

We found this on the dev-list.
Have you resolved this issue?
We just encountered the same problem in our production setup.
We did not have this issue in the past so we're not sure what to make of it.
This is the first time we're using a hardware loadbalancer to forward 
smtp from 25 to 1025.
Could that be causing this problem somehow?

Lance,

Maybe I'm misunderstanding this.  Isn't the idea of the maintenance 
branch is that it is supposed to be a stable build for those of us not 
running off of head?

I guess what I'm asking is this - is it easier for the developers to 
change their tools to point to a new branch for the next point release 
or is it easier to ask the community to change their established 
procedures for rolling out the software?

Bill

Lance,

Thanks for the reply.  I was just asking because we are going to try to 
run as close to the tip of the spear** as we can, given our small staff. 
(Yes, you convinced me to just suck it up and do it on the ride back 
from the reception at UT Austin.)

So if I am hearing you correctly - the proper branch to pull for a 
spring release is now the 2-1-1 if we need/want the current latest and 
greatest code that is *reasonably* stable.  is this correct?
Bill



---+++---+++---+++---+++---+++---+++---+++---+++---
Bill,

That is right.  The sakai_2-1-1 branch will be the best thing to use for
about six weeks.  We will then move everyone back to the sakai_2-1 branch.
Sorry if this is confusing, but sakai_2-1 will also be stable but will be
considered tip of the spear, while sakai_2-1-1 will be just behind the tip.
Once sakai 2.1.1 is released the sakai_2-1-1 branch will go away.  This will
likely be the procedure we follow as we do formal dot releases.  L

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/387>","I've been working with our DBAs to track down the excessive number of 
Oracle connections we're seeing in our local sakai instance.  With the 
following configuration in sakai.properties:

initialSize@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=5
maxActive@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=5
maxIdle@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=5
minIdle@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=5

we would expect to see only 5 connections, but we consistently see 15.  
It looks like both rWiki and Samigo create their own datasource by 
extending the javax.sql.BaseDataSource bean.  This leads to a tripling 
of the number of connections.  With lots of app servers in the cluster, 
this has the potential to cause problems with our Oracle instance.

We're going to dial down the number of connections in rWiki and Samigo 
by changing the spring configs in each of the tools, so this isn't going 
to cause us any problems... I just want folks out there in the community 
know what we've found w.r.t. DB connections.

I'm also curious if there a specific reason these tools have chosen to 
use their own datasources.  I saw some comments in the rWiki config 
files that made me think this was an intentional choice (possibly for 
using a custom session factory with hibernate triggers?).

Thanks,
Josh

The latest rome jar on ibiblio is 0.5:

http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/rome/jars/

People who want to use Dave's patch have to add the latest version 
(0.7) to their local repo. It looks like 0.7 is really a beta, so it 
hasn't been put up yet into ibiblio.

I seem to get this if I try to do the setJpegPhoto call in a script. I
don't seem to get it if I don't try to set the users photo. If I don't
make this call I don't see the error.  Also that call doesn't seem to
work to set the photo (though that could be an error in my script) - is
SakaiPerson.setJpegPhoto() the way one should be getting institutional

I have inspired myself in that class (oncourse) to do the user's profile 
synchronization. That worked perfectly and all the information was saved 
into the profiles.
But when the user tries to modify its profile, the referred excelptions 
are thrown...

Note: I now noticed that these exceptions only occur when the profile 
has the institutional photo set!

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/386>","Afternoon everyone:

I am trying to track down a error we are seeing in Apache logs for CAS.
This is not Sakai specific, but I wanted to see if anyone in the list
has experienced the same.  The error is:

[error] mod_cas: certificate error: bad cert or verisignserverca.pem is
not available.

Now as this person said in January (who has similar problem but I found
no resolution
http://tp.its.yale.edu/pipermail/cas/2005-January/000993.html) this
error seems very obvious.  However it escapes me as well.

We are using Apache 2.0.53 on Solaris 9, against Sakai 1.5.1 and Tomcat
5.0.28.  I am passed to the CAS server, authenticate etc, but when
passed back through Apache, this is the error that is returned in the
logs.  The CAS server is a 2.0 version.  

I have read notes that the mod_cas is not compatible with the 2.0
version.  Further, I have tried various certificates in the required
location.  Including the servers specific and the servers CA (Thawte).

Any pointers are appreciated.

Thanks,

Kevin

To some degree this is exactly what is happening.

We are getting ready to release 2.1.1 so we need to make a place  
(branch) that is focused on stabilizing, QAing, and releasing 2.1.1 -  
at the same time, there is a branch that is on track to become 2.1.2  
and a branch that is on track to become 2.2.

We do one thing a little differently than other projects.  Some sites  
agressively deploy from the trunk of the maintenance branch right  
into production on a regular basis.  This is not recommended for any  
sites unless the site has staff watching the maintenance branch  
carefully.  Also sometimes folks doing small pilots just grab the tip  
of the maintenance branch.

Lance is telling these ""aggressive deploy"" folks stick with the 2.1.1  
branch for the next few weeks and not follow down the 2.1.2 branch  
until he says that it is again in good shape.

These are all moving targets, and these little tactical bits only  
affect folks who are rolling to production from the maintenance  
branch, some on a weekly basis.  Normal sites should stick with the  
numbered and QA'd releases and ignore all of this talk about branches.

We are looking at trying to set up a back up mechnism for the  
resources sectiions of users, projects and courses.  It seems like  
the web dav interface might be a workable solution if we were able to  
get mappings for resources sections and to have the back-up software  
pull files from those folders.  Is it possible to access the web dav  
mappings for resources in the database to resource folders to create  
a back-up script?

I am currently backing up my resources section on my desktop using  
this procedure but I obviously know the address to the folder and  
this is not a changing or growing constanly.

Thanks

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/369>","I would like to create some different user account types, and modify the
tools / quota's for these account types. However I am unclear of
where-abouts in the administration worksite I should be making these
changes. Sorry for these rather basic questions, but it really isn't
clear to me how I should do this, and would really appreciate it if
someone could spare the time to point me in the right direction.

Specifically, I would like to:
- create three account types: Undergrad_student , Postgrad_student and
Tutor.
- set different default sizes for there workspace quota's, for example
Undergrads - 1mb , Postgrads  - 2mb and Tutors - 10mb.
- provide different tool lists in the ""my workspace"", depending on the
account type.
- set the resources size of project sites.

Is there a step-by-step guide somewhere that explains how to go about
these tasks?

Also in worksite setup, I cannot see user ""My Workspace"" sites, clicking
on View ""My Workspace sites"", simply gives a message ""No sites were
found in the view of ""My Workspace"", despite their being existing user
workspace's (with content).

I'm using Sakai 2.1.0 (maintenance branch:
https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/branches/sakai_2-1/), with MySQL 4.1
.

Paul

2.2, 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 are all moving targets with different people  
working on them.  We cannot stop 2.1.2 for for the few weeks it will  
take to QA 2.1.1 because 2.1.2 needs to be ready mid-February.

Stick with numbered releases if you want to run code that has been  
QA'd.  If you choose to run from the maintenance branch straight into  
production - you should stay in touch with the person who is moving  
things to the maintenance branch.

Our goal is to get numbered releases out often enough to make it so  
people are not tempted to go to the maintenance branch.  Hence 2.1.1.  
in the first weeks of January.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/384>","When following the instructions below to install the sakai plug-in permanently 
in maven I encountered a few situations that require an explanation:

1) the operation ultimately failed because maven could not sucessfully download
common.jelly.jars from cvs.sakaiproject.org/maven/  
is this failure due to the reorganization of the CVS tree due to branch/trunk maintenance? I could download the required .jars from another source, is this the best course of action?  if so, where is maven putting the dowbloaded . jar files ?

2) Does this build procedure work for Maven version 2 or 
only Maven version 1? Has maven version 2 been tested at all for the Sakai project? ( I dont think so because I ran into a multitude of issues )

This is something that's not really explained in the presentation:
The maven goals used by Sakai are only available if the maven sakai 
plugin is available. The plugin is available in two ways:
1) if you run maven against a project.xml file that has the sakai 
plugin as a dependency. See the project.xml file in the top-level 
Sakai source directory for an example of this.
2) if you install the Sakai plugin permanently into your maven 
installation. This is performed with the command maven 
plugin:download -DartifactId=sakai -DgroupId=sakaiproject -
Dversion=2.1 -Dmaven.repo.remote=http://cvs.sakaiproject.org/maven/

In practical terms, this means that if you run maven in the same 
directory as the top level of the Sakai source code, you won't get 
the 'Goal ""sakai:build"" does not exist in this project.' error. On 
the other hand, if you just install the Sakai plugin for maven, you 
can run maven in any directory and it will know about all the maven 
sakai goals.

For your reference, here is a list of all the goals in the Sakai 
plugin for maven:
sakai ............................................ clean then build 
then deploy
sakai:build  ................................. compile and package 
the build
sakai:clean ................................. cleanup from prior builds
sakai:clean_build  ..................... clean and then build
sakai:clean_build_deploy  ...... clean then build then deploy
sakai:deploy  ............................. deploy to the local tomcat
sakai:deploy-report  ................. Report on what jars Sakai 
deploys - which
projects 
deploy what to where
sakai:deploy-zip  ...................... deploy to the 
maven.deploy.home and zip a
tomcat 
overlay structure
sakai:undeploy  ....................... remove from the local tomcat

Dependencies identified in Maven project files are resolved by JARs and

sakaiproject.org repository or from iBiblio.com.

Maven creates a local repository on your computer system in 
~/.maven/repository, where ~ is your home directory.

Sakai only works with Maven 1.0 at this time.  Do not use Maven 2.x.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/390>","I have just installed a new instance of 2.1

I first started with the HSQL to make sure the deployment was good.

I then setup and converted the instance to use MYSql, turning on auto
ddl and the convert string.

I verified the system was reading against the db by changing the admin
password and seeing the field change in the db.

I then tried to add a new site. The site will ""attempt"" to add but not
appear to finish. The site, in Worksite setup, will have the long guid
number name (6743a223-9a79-4778-8007-bc5889f63648 ). This will also
appear on the name in the tab. If I look in Sakai_Site table, it is
there but with the guid name not the one I provided. Also when I try to
access the site I get ""site not avialable""

Looking at the Tomcat log I see this error:
INFO:
org.sakaiproject.component.legacy.content.DbContentService@1ecfeb.init()
: tables: CONTENT_COLLECTION CONTENT_RESOURCE
CONTENT_RESOURCE_BODY_BINARY locks-in-db: false bodyPath: e:\Program
Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\sakai\content (2006-01-06
17:18:50,307 

It appears the path is bad, but that is in fact the path on the Windows
file system. 

I have these two lines from the Sakai properties file:
bodyPath@org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.content.ContentHostingService =
${sakai.home}\content\
bodyVolumes@org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.content.ContentHostingServic
e = vol1,vol2,vol3

I have not changed the Sakai default ""home"" location.

If I archive one of the built in sites, it works and creates the folder
and contents.

Any ideas?

I have been around the email archive on the past days and noticed the 
following behaviors/issues which you may hopefuly help me:

1. Although site members receive email notifications from the 
Announcements tool, new member notifications (when an user is added to a 
site) are not sent;

2. There is no postmaster@yyyy.xxx configuration is sakai (at least, I 
was unable to find). My workaround was setting an alias postmaster for 
the ""Administration Workspace"" and then join me as a member: this lead 
to the point below:

3. If ""Email archive"" is added to ""Administration Workspace"", email is 
not sent to its members (member have configured to receive these mails);

4. The most strange situation:
- there are 2 maintain users added to Site A: user#1 was created by 
the java API, user#2 was created by the User tool;
- all have ""mail.delete.any"" function in their realms;
- the button ""Delete"" (on Email Archive) appears to both users when 
logged;
- #2 is able to delete sucessfuly any email;
- #1 is presented with ""Please confirm the removal of this email 
archive message:"" (normal) but after pressing Delete the following 
appears: ""Alert: You do not have permission to remove this message.""
I have searched through the Sakai tables searching for some unusual 
or unset permission (function) but found nothing. Does anyone have a 
clue about what's going on?

Thank you all,
Nuno Fernandes.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/391>","Hi all, it is Saturday morning and I am sitting here with my cup of  
coffee so it is probably time for a status update.  Hope you all had  
good holidays and took some time off.  I had a great time learning  
Cocoa and Eclipse on my days off.

We have Sakai 2.2 penciled in for July 15 - we will likely need a  
longer QA period for 2.2 than any other previous version of Sakai  
because we will be integrating a number of new software from the  
community.  We may need to do QA from May 15 through July 15.

Sakai 2.1.1 is already in the works - we should tag this soon and  
begin QA.  Hopefully the 2.1.1 QA will be pretty straightforward.   
The maintenance branch code which makes up 2.1.1 is already in  
production at IU, so at some level the key element for community QA  
for 2.1.1 is to make sure we have no regressions from 2.1.

Sakai 2.1.2 is also in the works.  This is scheduled for freeze for  
2.1.2 in mid February and QA after that.  If all goes well, Sakai  
2.1.2 will be the base for OSP 2.1 and we will (finally) be at the  
point where the OSP and Sakai code bases are synchronized.  The nice  
thing about 2.1.2 is that the OSP team will be doing QA on Sakai so  
we will have a more significant QA effort on the 2.1.2+OSP package.   
The hope is that folks can go to 2.1.2 Sakai and then ""drop in OSP"".   
It might not be that simple when it all works out - but that is the  
hope.

In terms of personnel, you have probably heard by now that Carol  
Dippel resigned as Sakai QA Director back in December.  She will  
still be involved - just not as the QA lead.  Carol did a great job  
for the Sakai project and she produced outstanding results in a  
challenging environment.    We miss her leadership already.

We really cannot go for long without a QA Director - we are working  
on Carol's replacement and hope to have it all worked out and  
announced in time for the new director to lead the 2.1.1 QA effort.

Some big follow on work after the Austin conference is the Sakai  
Community Practices group.  This is in the process of forming a  
charter.  See http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/SCP/ 
Charter for more details.

Another important area is the Requirements Group.  There is now a  
really cool requirements form in JIRA.  Go to http:// 
bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira, Create New Issue, Project: Sakai  
Requirements, Issue Type: Requirement.  The Requirements DG is going  
to lead a process where the community enters requirements, then  
prioritizes these requirements, and then we use the resulting list  
and try to find resources between now and   May 15 to work on those  
requirements that the community wants the most.  Of course the best  
way to get your favourite requirement worked on is to work on it  
yourself :)

/Chuck

I have been watching Zach Thomas's new blockbuster movie, and I
was able to build Sakai from source and the thing appears to run fine.  
Then I got to
the part where I import all the source files into Eclipse.  I set the 
MAVEN_REPO
classpath variable to:

C:/Documents and Settings/gpp8p/.maven/repository

Note - I am runnint Eclipse 3.1.1 with the MyEclipse plugin - the 
milestone 2
release (that's a beta release of MyEclipse).

I do the import, and everything comes in fine.  However, there are a 
slew of errors:

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/393>","We've started moving to 2.1. We're starting to move the Rutgers  
patches listed in Jira 2505 from 2.0.1 to 2.1. Other Rutgers staff  
will do most of this. I'm doing AccessServlet. It's been refactored,  
so most of the changes to into BaseContentService.java. Because I'm  
giving you only the changes to those modules, some feature are only  
half there. They depend upon changes to other files, which will have  
to come from other people. [However I believe that they can be easily  
adapted from the 2.0.1 patches, which you can find from Jira 2505.]

These changes are in a tar file attached to Jira 3442.

Implements 4 features. (These features are completely implemented by  
this patch. See below for the ones that are partly implemented.)

1) Aliases. If you create a mail alias for a site, you can access its  
resource section with the same alias, e.g. http://server/access/myalias
2) Content view. If you access a folder (as opposed to an individual  
resource)  via /access/content, normally you get an error. With this  
patch you will get a directory listing in a format that is  
appropriate for end users. It shows the description of the folder and  
each item, so it looks a lot like a Melete organizer page.
3) If you specify ?basedir=xxx or ?sbasedir=xxx [for Sferyx],  
directory listings have a special format intended to support pick  
lists in HTML editors. Our users want to be able to insert images  
easily in HTML. Part of that is for the HTML editor to be able to  
show them a listing on their /images directory and make it easy to  
pick an image. This is the server side of that. The basedir format  
should be easy to use in any Javascript code. The sbasedir format is  
tuned specifically for Sferyx' file picker.
4) implemented file upload via HTTP POST operations. This is also  
intended for HTML editors, to let them upload images. Sferyx uses  
this technique, and I believe other HTML editors do as well.

Interaction with other patches. I don't yet have 2.1.0 versions of  
our other patches. However I believe the 2.0.1 versions may port  
fairly easily except for this patch. (This one was hard because  
AccessServlet was refactored for 2.1.0.) See Jira entry 2505 for a  
list of our 2.0.1 patches.

1) Users without write access to resources are prevented from seeing  
inside a directory whose name starts with ""protected."" Other parts of  
this feature are in  ResourcesAction.java, chef_resources_list.vm,  
chef_resoures_newlist.vm. If you don't want this feature, look for  
""protected"" (with the quote marks) in BaseContentService.java, and  
remove the whole paragraph (surrounded by blank lines).

2) Users can change the order of entries in resources. This patch  
uses the proper order in displaying directories, but ResourcesAction  
and the vm files [same list as (1)] need to be changed to let the use  
change the order, and to use the proper order in the Resources tool.

Sakai to store the blobs in the file system.

I am guessing that you are running this all on a PC as a test - so it  
makers perfect sense that

${sakai.home} ends up being the path to the tomcat running on your PC.

Storing bodies on the file system is a petty advanced feature.     It  
is in the file system where Tomcat is running - not the filesystem on  
the mysql server.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/397>","Johan,

There is not a current activity (that I know of) to search out and  
find all of these.

My suggestion is to file a JIRA on this and send in a patch.   Keep  
the JIRA specific to the problem you see (i.e. don't file a JIRA that  
says - ""look through all the code and..."").

A few people (Lance, Chuck, Glenn, and John E) have discussed the  
notion having someone go through and look at every single catch block  
in Sakai and review them for appropriateness.  At least some type of  
logging might want to be added at places.

This is a pretty hard task because in a layered architecture low  
level routines are called from many contexts and sometimes it is hard  
to discern whether this failed SQL query was just the query to check  
to see if the connection was still up or if this was a critical query  
whose failure needed to be placed in the log and someone needs to  
have a pager message sent immediately.

So at times, it is not a good idea to log everything right at the  
moment it is enoucntered, but instead throw it and catch it farther  
up where code is more aware of what is going on.  But when this is  
done, sometimes API changes percolate upward - and at times there are  
abstraction boundaries where we need exceptions to be generic - so it  
is a fine art.

So we need to record these and fix them.  Jim Eng has been working on  
adding a lot of error checking in content hosting - especially in the  
store body on disk code - perhaps we need to take your patches and  
merge them into Jim's work on the store bodies in the DB side.

*******

That brings up another question - why are you storing bodies in the  
DB at all?  UNISA is a BIG site - this is not a small pilot.  Storing  
resource bodies in MySql will likely bring your system to its knees  
*very quickly*.  Within a few months, you may not even be able to get  
a backup of MySql to run because it will become so large so quickly.

The GUI ""delete user"" only does a very minimal delete operation, and leaves 
intact all sorts of user information, recorded in JIRA as:

http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-655
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-1456
http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-1535

There was a sakai-dev thread on this which moved to framework in Dec 05. This is 
either a bug or a design issue, depending on your point of view. Personally I 
think there's room for improvement in the default behaviour.

all our batch imports for resources are succeeding, but looking at the
data through the portal, the files are there but have no content.

Upon further investigation, it became apparent that our MySQL ran out of
space on the content body table, and was returning an error in the
insert, but the content service blatantly ignored the error and came
back with a false positive upon resource import.

This concerns me for all the obvious reasons...

Looking deeper into sakai, it appears that there are several scenarios
(not just resources) whereby an exception is wrongly discarded, and the
caller does not get notified of a failure.

Any patch/fix that will stop things like this from happening again?

No need to rewrite.  Lets just put 0.7 in the Sakai maven until it  
makes it for ibiblio.

Send the jar to Glenn.

Does anyone have this patch in committable form, once the jar is ready?

It looks like John L and Nuno F provided you with prompt, pointed feedback
(thanks, you two!). This does sound like a permissions problem. Either
approach (sakai's helper) or Nuno's perl script will do the trick (propagate
the melete permissions down to your existing sites). 

Let us know if there are any pending issues with your Melete installation.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/400>","OK - as I noted I have been fighting Apache's mod_cas and mod_cas
stating I have an invalid certificate.  I know I have the exact
certificate for the CA as I have installed it directly from them (in
this case Thawte).  I confirmed by viewing my CAS server that it is the
correct CA certificate as well (Thawte has multiple).  However it still
tells me the cert is invalid etc etc.

So my next question is can you use CASFilter with Sakai 1.5.1?
Everything I see shows it only with Sakai 2.0.  Just would like to get a
confirmation before I start down another path.

Thanks in advance,

Yes, you can. I successfully used a CAS-like filter for a 1.5
installation that I just decommissioned. It's very similar to
applying a filter on 2.x

You'll find a lot of 1.5-related CAS information at the bottom of
the Confluence entry about CAS-ification:

I'll poke around tomorrow for the exact files.

also available in the resources area of the Web Services collab group.

This is based off discussions and suggestions recieved from various 
folks on mailing lists, and things I personally want to do.  I'm the 
only person who's seen this, so I'm expecting there will be a lot of 
comments, suggestions, and corrections.  I'm guessing these should go to 
the webservices list.

Also on the WS Collab group, I've created a short survey you can take.  
It's only 13 questions, and lets you rate the Line Items from 1 (not 
important) to 5 (totally radical), as well as give written input.  It 
will be available for a week, after which I'll compile and publish the 
results.

If you are interested in working on any of the line items, you can email 
the Web Service list or myself... or just start coding/documenting and 
collaborate/experiment.

I'm looking forward to the 2.2 release. I think we have enough time to 
do some really cool stuff. As usual, some things may make this release, 
others may have to wait, and some may always live in contrib.

Thanks,
Steve

I feel that these modifications are effectively upwards compatible  
and add good features that cause no harm to any of the current ways  
that code works.  I would like to simply move these patches into  
trunk so Chuck does not have to maintain these.  But I would like to  
hear from others who like these patches or think that these patches  
should not just become part of Sakai.

These features need documenting.  We need a document ~dev/sakai/docs/ 
architecture/sakai_access.doc  that describes these features of  
access servlet in a style similar to the other documents in this  
directory.  There is not a current document on access servlet so one  
should be started.  To me documenting these features for posterity is  
an important aspect to getting these features into the code base.   
The simplest would be for Chuck H to write up the document - if not  
it will wait until someone else gets around to writing the document.   
I don't want to hold up the progress on moving this to trunk with a  
demand for documentation - but it is a strong desire that we don't go  
too far without writing the internal developer documentation so that  
folks can use these features.  It is always easier to write up basic  
documentation while things are fresh in people's minds.

This feature is something that needs to be discussed.  Security by  
naming convention is a quick way to add a feature but can result in  
brittle code.  Chuck H - lets keep this one separate and keep talking  
about this.  My concern with this feature is its design approach from  
a technical level - so we need to keep working on this.

So I would suggest that you make a separate JIRA item - call it  
something like ""Adding protected folders and files to Content  
Hosting"" and publish a patch.  Perhaps this is best done as a  
requirement because it really is a request for new feature which also  
happens to have a patch.

I think that this is a feature that many would like.  I would also  
like to keep this patch separate from the others.  My concern here is  
two-fold - first we need to look at how this is done storage-wise and  
whether the approach used for storage of the ordering information  
will perform at scale (we had a performance problem on the first  
implementation of tab ordering).  The second concern I have is the  
user interface.   Lots of people have opinions about how the  
Resources user interface is supposed to look and when the resources  
tool user interface is changed we need to get a lot of eyes on the  
proposed changes.  So before we go forward on this I would like to  
see some kind of design proposed and made available for folks to look  
at.

We don't really have a good ""procedure"" for how we do this ""hey take  
a look at this design"" and give comments.  I would propose that in  
lieu of waiting for a formal process that we come up with a  
confluence page which takes some screenshots of the current modified  
tool running at Rutgers in 2.0, add some descriptive text and get  
some discussion around the changes so we can get some agreement from  
the Resource tool stakeholders before going forward.

I would also suggest that you make a separate JIRA called something  
like ""Ordering items in the Resource Tool"" and publish your patches  
here for folks to play with.  Also entering a requirement would be a  
good idea. Perhaps this is really just a requirement...

As Jim Eng has said separately this code (Resources Tool) is a real  
moving target right now.  The end-user interface is not changing much  
at all, but it is being re factored in terms of *how* things are done  
internally for 2.1.2.  It is going from a monolithic tool to a set of  
cooperating helper tools.  SO expect that you will have to end up  
with a 2.1, 2.1.2, and possibly even a 2.1.1 version of this patch.   
Chances are good that the code won't change too much (similar to the  
Access Servlet refactor above) but it will be in different places and  
different files.

Since you are deploying 2.1 - the only patch that matters for you is  
the 2.1 versions of the patch (for now).

---- To the community ----

We all have a responsibility to take a look at these modifications -  
one of the best ways to know that folks ""like"" a particular patch and  
that the patch is high quality is for more than one site to  
successfully run it in production.  This pattern worked very well for  
things like the SU tool - since several sites had already run it  
successfully it dropped into the release with barely  a ripple.  So I  
will be looking for some community reaction to and investment in  
these patches.  If community simply say ""yes do them all"", that is  
fine input, but the speed at which these patches move forward depends  
solely on when folks from IU and UM have time.

It is much better input when the folks in the community say ""I ran  
all of this in production for several months - it ran fast and  
reliably and my users loved it"".  :)

---- Summary  -----

Please separate this into three thrusts.

The Access Servlet stuff can likely fold in nicely to trunk - I  
looked this code over in 2.0 and actually tried to get it into 2.1  
but ran out of time - since the Access code refactor is already done  
in 2.1 - your patches should be solid for all 2.1 and 2.1.x versions  
giving us time to get them into trunk so you don't have to separately  
maintain these.

The ContentHosting stuff has some design issues.  Keep it separate -  
use it at Rutgers - when we get some time, we need to talk about the  
right way to do this for the long term.  This should probably become  
a ""requirement"" where the need is expressed in end-user terms.

The Resources tool ordering just needs some eyes to look at the GUI  
changes and ""sign off"" - this code is in the midst of refactor so  
keep these patches nice and separate and expect to have to keep  
moving the patches around through 2.1.2 - work with Jim Eng and  
perhaps we can smooth out some of the refactor bumps.  At a minimum,  
since Jim knows about these patches, Jim can let you know when things  
have settled down so that you can work together to make the patches  
work in 2.1.2 while the refactor is fresh in Jim's mind.

argh! oops, I'll take a look at that!

Lance/Glenn, I take it we should be using the javax.sql.Datasource?

I fully agree that an overall document on the access servlet would be  
very useful and I agree that the waiting until one exists before the  
code can get integrated will slow progress.  A pragmatic middle  
ground would be to require good javadocs for code that changes.   The  
javadocs should be there anyway, they don't require updating other  
documents, they don't require finding a place to put the  
documentation, they can be a great aid to anyone looking at the code,  
and if it turns into a big task to describe what is going on, that  
doesn't bode well for the maintainability of the code.

I have done some poking. You will need to place the CAS Filter on the 
sakai-dispatch app that resides in /usr/local/sakai. Specifically, you 
need to add the appropriate XML to:

/usr/local/sakai/sakai-real/sakai-dispatch/WEB-INF/web.xml

I chose to do this around line 100. Here's a snippet:

[...]
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
-->

<!-- CAS Filter -->
<filter>
<filter-name>CAS Filter</filter-name>
<filter-class>edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.CASFilter</filter-class>

<init-param>
<param-name>edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.loginUrl</param-name>
<param-value>https://secure.its.yale.edu/cas/login</param-value>
</init-param>

<init-param>
<param-name>edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.validateUrl</param-name>
<param-value>https://secure.its.yale.edu/cas/serviceValidate</param-value>
</init-param>

<init-param>
<param-name>edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.serverName</param-name>
<param-value>your server name and port (e.g., www.yale.edu:8080)</param-value>
</init-param>

<init-param>
<param-name>edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.wrapRequest</param-name>
<param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>

</filter>

<filter-mapping>
<filter-name>CAS Filter</filter-name>
<url-pattern>/tunnel/sakai-chef-tool/authn</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>

<!-- =========================== -->

<!-- Now setup tunnel servlets for the different requests.
[...]

The wrapRequest setting allows the container auth to work and URL 
pattern given above is correct (you may wish to experiment with /* 
depending on your set up). The rest is a generic example that I stole 
from:

http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CAS/Using+CASFilter

which is a good reference.

Once you have made the above edits and placed the CAS jar in an 
accessible place, you will still need to edit the Tomcat server.xml, 
sakai.properties, and most likely the Login UI.

Not quite sure of this but, the thrown exception could mean that the 
object (Profile) being saved to db is obsolete (it was opened, modified 
and saved in other place, meanwhile)?...

I've already commented separately that I don't think this is the way  
to do this. I do patches differently when I know I'm going to have to  
put them in every release than if I were the implementor. If I were  
the implementor I would create a permission for doing a directory  
listing, or I would provide a place to store items separate from the  
resources area (the attachments directory is an example of this) that  
the instructor could browse but not the students. However the HTML  
editor's file picker would have to be able to browse it.

I've submitted a requirement about this and other features needed to  
support HTML editors.

I'm not in a position to submit a patch yet because portions of the  
code (in files I didn't look at) haven't been moved to 2.1 yet.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/436>","Hi, George. Thanks for saying my movie is a blockbuster, though I  
don't think I'll be getting any calls from the Academy.

Anyway, getting Eclipse to build everything perfectly is more of an  
art than a science. Or not even art; you pretty much have to hit it  
over the head repeatedly until everything works properly. I neatly  
sidestepped this whole problem in my demo. If you'll notice, right  
before I import all the Sakai modules into Eclipse, I go to the  
Project menu and uncheck ""Build Automatically."" This prevents Eclipse  
from even *attempting* to build everything itself.

All those errors about missing dependencies are the result of maven  
having not yet built up your local repository. You have to run a full  
maven build of Sakai at least once for all the necessary dependencies  
to be in the .maven/repository directory.

And as far as all the errors about projects not building because  
projects that depend on them haven't been built, you should try  
building the modules one at a time by using the ""Clean"" command under  
the Project menu. Do the util module first, then kernel, then try the  
others in no particular order.

But bear in mind that getting Eclipse to behave is not strictly  
necessary. That's why I could switch off automatic builds in Eclipse  
with no consequences. All the building and deploying ultimately  
happens at the command line with maven.

I can now definitely confirm this on TRUNK running on MySQl:

1) Started with clean database
2) created a user
3) used a script to set the the users profile including setJpegPhoto()
4) checked that the profile existed in the DB and that the photo was
correctly set (by extracting the photo and viewing)
5) Logged in as user:
1) No photo was visible despite ""Use University Id Picture"" being true
(no error returned)
2) when the user tries to edit their profile Sakai throws the
hibernate.StaleObjectStateException

Perhaps this could be a Mysql specific error if the code works fine for
Indiana?

(I'll do some more research and see if I can find out where it is)

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/406>","Hi George,

I am actually using Eclipe for modules modification/customization etc, 
but do not deploy directly from Eclipse.
This is what I did:
- set MAVEN_REPO classpath variable in Eclipse (DONE);
- set TOMCAT_HOME classpath variable in Eclipse;
- do a ""maven sakai:clean_build"" (will place most required jars in 
maven repository)

This will (hopefuly) solve most errors!
Maven uses a different way for setting the classpath (project.xml) - in 
Eclipse this is set in "".classpath"". The important one for proper 
compilation is the maven classpath - eclipse classpath is stil very 
useful here but is not mandatory.

Not quite sure if these are all the required steps.
Nuno.

Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.sakai.devel/417>","If the system is configured so each user sees all their sites in the 
file picker, an instructor can place resources in her own workspace and 
then attach them to any assignment/calendar event/discussion item/etc 
without students being able to discover them easily independent of that 
entity.  In 2.1.0, the attachment is a copy of the original resource.  
Soon I expect that we will also enable the attachment of links to the 
original resource.

My point here is that I believe this requirement is already satisfied 
without any need for a patch.  An instructor teaching a course named 
""Course X"" could create a ""Course X"" folder in her own workspace, place 
all the resources for the semester in that folder whenever, and then 
create attachments to those resources or move them into the course 
resources folder whenever she chooses.

I like the idea of eventually adding the capability to set release 
dates and retraction dates on resources. I believe there is a JIRA 
ticket requesting that capability, but we haven't yet come up with a 
design for the user interface or the underlying infrastructure.  That 
may be quite simple, but other issues have higher priority at the 
moment.

Thanks.

Jim

Here is my proposal.  Lets make a requirement for ""changing the order  
of items in resources"". Then make a confluence space for it.  Then  
someone probably Chuck H needs to put in a design proposal into  
Confluence.

Then folks can go round-and-round about this in confluence and when  
consensus happens, report it back to this group and annotate the  
requirement in JIRA.

Just an idea.

If you want to insert a specific patch in the central source, I'll be  
happy to give you diffs of specific feature, but I can only afford to  
do it once per feature, at a point when I know you will take it.

Please - and it's what the project has provided for this.
Doing so gives us a better chance of finding patches.
And whoever the trunk-committers are can indicate which 'candidate' 
patches have been moved up into the trunk, and when.

AdditionalHibernateMappingsImpl method that John Ellis introduced (many
thanks to John!).  This method has the benefit of having ONE Hibernate

transactions to work across Managers).  Do not worry about transactions
failing subtly; you will get a big fat stack trace if you run into this
problem.



We are recommending that all Hibernate based tools switch to this new
methodology ASAP.  For an example see:

argh! oops, I'll take a look at that!



Lance/Glenn, I take it we should be using the javax.sql.Datasource?
